<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The trail journals of the first two government exploring
expeditions commanded by Lieutenant John
Charles Frémont, of the United States Engineers, and
advised by Kit Carson, mountain-man, are to be found
together published, spring of 1845, as reports transmitted
by the Secretary of War to the National Senate
and House.</p>

<p>These journals, recording peril and privation
faced for the wide public good and not for narrow
private gain, occupy their honored niche among the
golden archives of the Republic, and should be better
known in American school and home. The trails
themselves are eternal, denoted by names which have
endured, many of them, unto this day. Of the men
who may proudly and truthfully say, “I was with
Frémont,” or “I was with Carson,” few indeed remain;
and they will soon be gone, for man passes on,
while that which he has wrought survives.</p>

<p>The Oliver Wiggins in this narrative is real. I
have talked with him. He was the little boy under
the wagon, and he was the Taos lad who won the
Kit Carson rifle; he was upon the Frémont and
Carson First Expedition, and he was upon the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Expedition, by way of the Salt Lake to Fort Hall.
However, there he turned back, with the other Carson
men. In taking him through, as in having him ascend
the highest peak, voyage the Salt Lake in the rubber
boat, and be prominent in various such adventures, I
have added to his biography as told to me. Yet in
these credits I have not exalted him more than is his
due, for brave men rarely tell of all that they have
done well.</p>

<p>The other personages also are real, as members
of the Frémont or of the Carson party. Some of the
conversation is quoted from the Frémont reports; the
remainder is applied according to the characteristics
of the speakers, or is adapted from sentiments expressed
at divers times and places. The incidents of
course are based upon the Frémont journals, with sidelights
from the recollections of Major Wiggins, and
from the Frémont “Memoirs of My Life,” and like
chronicles bearing upon the day.</p>

<p>The two principals, Lieutenant (later Captain,
Colonel and General) Frémont, and Scout (later Colonel
and General) Christopher Carson, thought highly
each of the other; and this is warrant that they were
manly men. Manly men respect manly men. Lieutenant
Frémont said: “With me, Carson and truth
are the same thing;” and he refers to their “enduring
friendship.” Kit Carson left all—new ranch,
home, wife, dear associates—which, save honor, he
valued most, to accompany the lieutenant upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Third Expedition, and in every crisis of march, camp,
battle and politics he stuck stanchly to him. “I owe
more to Colonel Frémont than to any other man
alive,” he declared. Thus friend should stand by
friend.</p>

<p>This Third Expedition, of 1845–1846, again into
the Great Basin and across the Sierra Nevada Range
to the Valley of the Sacramento, was timed to the
conquest of California by American arms; but it is
another long story. Following the Third Expedition,
having resigned from the Army Colonel Frémont, in
1848–1849, voluntarily conducted a Fourth Expedition,
upon which many lives were lost to cold and
hunger amidst the winter mountains of south central
Colorado; and in 1853–1854, a Fifth Expedition, once
more across the Great Basin to California. In these
two expeditions Kit Carson did not take part. He
had the duties of home, and family, which also are
man’s duties; and the duties of agent over the Ute
and Apache Indians.</p>

<p>After that, came Civil War service for both
friends, in fields separate.</p>

<small>KIT CARSON TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the middle of November, 1840; and across
the sandy face of southwestern Kansas was toiling,
outward bound from Missouri, a Santa Fé caravan:
fifty-two huge, creaking canvas-topped wagons, drawn
each by six or eight span of mules or yoke of oxen.</p>

<p>In this day the so-called foreign government of
Mexico extended north through New Mexico to the
Arkansas River in Colorado and southwestern Kansas.
The United States stopped at the Rocky Mountains;
and, moreover, from Missouri to the Rockies
all was “Indian Country” and the “Great American
Desert.” From Missouri extended two long roads
or trails, separating like a “V” with its point near
present Kansas City. Up the Platte River, for the
Northwest, ran the old trappers’ and fur-traders’ trail,
now being made the Oregon Trail of emigrants. Up
the Arkansas River, for the Southwest, ran the trail
of the Santa Fé caravans. The desolate, unimproved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Great American Desert was like a sea; and across this
sea sailed, spring and fall, upon an 800 mile voyage,
fleets of American wagons, to trade with the capital
of northern Mexico.</p>

<p>They took out cargoes of calico, powder, lead,
flour, shoes, and such American products; they brought
back, at profit in money and at loss in life, cargoes of
furs, hides, gold, gay blankets and such Mexican
products.</p>

<p>This caravan of November, 1840, with its fifty-two
wagons and harnessed teams, had at the beginning
of the journey stretched out in a line almost a mile
of length. Each wagon had a teamster. Some of the
teamsters straddled the near animal of the wheel
span (the span next to the wagon); others, in their
boots and flannel shirts and broad hats, walked beside
the wagon; horsemen, escort to the wagon-captain,
who was the boss of the train, led the march, reconnoitering
ahead; other horsemen paced at right and
left; and at the rear of all, upon an old mule, driving
a collection of loose horses and mules, rode a ragged
little boy—Oliver Wiggins.</p>

<p>This was Oliver’s place—in the dust, at the tail of
the long caravan. His duty was to herd the “cavvy,”
as was styled for short the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballada</i> (Spanish for
horse-herd). His pay was five dollars a month, and
the fun and the glory, and the work, of fifty days’
travel, at the rate of fifteen miles a day, across the
plains of sand and sage, buffalo and antelope, hunger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and thirst, storm and Indians, to strange far-off
Santa Fé.</p>

<p>At first the march had been very pleasant. The
caravan sometimes had spread out over the prairie in
formation of four abreast. By day the teamsters had
sung and cracked their long whips, beside the wagons;
by night they had sung and told stories, beside the
camp-fires. Everybody had been happy. But within
the last two days the atmosphere had changed; for
there had come riding fast, on the homeward way
from Mexico, two traders, and had left the word,
with the captain:</p>

<p>“Watch sharp! The Kiowas are out!”</p>

<p>That was enough. Quickly through the caravan
spread the news—“<span class="smcap">The Kiowas are out!</span>” All
carelessness, all singing, ceased; and the order of
march was made double file or two abreast, so that in
case of attack the wagons could swing to right and
left and quickly join in a great circle.</p>

<p>The Kiowas! The fiercest fighting Indians of the
Southwest plains were they, outrivalled by neither
Pawnee nor Comanche. Their name was terrible to
the Santa Fé traders. Their range was southwestern
Kansas and southeastern Colorado, thence south into
the dread Comanche country below the Arkansas.
When the caravan had left Missouri, the Kiowas
were said to be at peace; but now they were said, on
good authority, to be <em>not</em> at peace, and well might
Wagon-Captain Blunt worry. He had a lot of green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
teamsters, poorly armed with old smooth-bore yagers;
and whether, if given time to form a circle of wagons,
they could beat off the painted warriors, he did not
know.</p>

<p>Holding the rear of all, boy Oliver Wiggins, aged
thirteen, left to the dust and the shuffling loose stock
(defenseless beasts, a prize for the Indians), also well
might worry. He wished now that he had not run away
from home; and he began to wonder whether, after all,
his pistol, about the size of the palm of his hand, was
large enough. This pistol had seemed to him weapon
in plenty for fighting Indians, in Missouri; but the
farther from Missouri he journeyed, and the more
stories he heard, the smaller the pistol grew.</p>

<p>Here in southwestern Kansas of to-day the Santa
Fé Trail veered south, beyond the Great Bend of the
river, to cross and to head for the Cimarron Desert
and for New Mexico. This, the Crossing of the Arkansas,
was half way to Santa Fé; but the half already
covered was the easy half, the half to come was the
dry, thirsty half, and the Kiowa and Comanche half.</p>

<p>Through the shallow water and the quick-sands
forged the wagons of the Blunt caravan, upon the
farther bank to halt, for camp and to fill the water-casks.
The sun was low and red in the west, the long,
high white-hooded wagons had been parked in the
customary circle, outside the circle camp-fires were
curling, pots were bubbling, meat was hissing, and
before each camp tethered animals were grazing; sentries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
had been posted, and boy Oliver, hungry and
grimy, was guarding his browsing cavvy, when a
sudden commotion struck the peaceful scene. A sentinel
upon a sand-hill fired his gun to signal “Injuns!
Injuns!” and rushed like wild-fire the word. Every
teamster sprang to round up his picketed team, or to
help collect the oxen; the sentries came in at a gallop;
and men sped to help Oliver with the cavvy. Through
the opening left in the circle of wagons poured men
and animals, from outside to inside. And against the
sunset glow could be descried a long file of black
mounted figures, approaching at rapid trot.</p>

<p>However, Captain Blunt, viewing them by spyglass,
shouted thankfully:</p>

<p>“Not Injuns, men! Whites! Look like traders.”</p>

<p>Whereupon a sigh of relief swept the tense cordon.</p>

<p>The cordon did not dare yet to open out again;
nevertheless, as the riders across the rolling sand-hills
neared, they were seen by the naked eye to be whites
indeed. They resolved into a double file of horsemen:
trapper-clad in fringed buckskin shirts and leggins, in
broad-brimmed hats, in moccasins, and every man carried
across his saddle-horn a tremendously long rifle.</p>

<p>“Mountain-men! Trappers!” announced Teamster
“Dutch” Jake, in Oliver’s hearing. “Now if we
only had <em>them</em> with us——!”</p>

<p>“They’re the chaps to make the Injuns stand
’round,” agreed another. And many a head nodded.</p>

<p>The cavalcade was within gun-shot. A man riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
alone was leader; and as on they came, at the steady,
fast “rack” or single-foot, straight for the camp, he
held up his hand, palm outward, in a peace sign.</p>

<p>“High jinks! I know that man!” exclaimed
“Dutch” Jake. And he added: “If it only be, now.”</p>

<p>Captain Blunt and two or three of his lieutenants,
carrying their guns, walked outside a few steps to meet
this leader. The conversation was wafted clearly
through the still, dry air, while all the camp listened.</p>

<p>“Howdy?”</p>

<p>“Howdy?”</p>

<p>“Who’s yore captain?” This from the horseman.</p>

<p>“I’m the captain.” This from Blunt.</p>

<p>“Wall, my name’s <a href="#i_fp022">Kit Carson</a>. We’ve come over
from Touse to ride the trail through Kiowa country,
with anybody that needs us. S’pose you know the
Kiowas air bad?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_22">CHRISTOPHER CARSON</a></div>
</div>

<p>“So we’ve heard. And we’re mighty glad to see
you, Mr. Carson,” declared Captain Blunt, reaching
up and shaking hands heartily.</p>

<p>Kit Carson! Kit Carson! The name passed from
lip to lip around the wagon cordon; and a hundred
eyes were fastened eagerly upon the spot where now
this leader squatted beside a fire, as guest and counsellor
of Captain Blunt.</p>

<p>The others in the party (which numbered about
forty) had unsaddled like lightning, had turned their
horses out, under a guard, and starting fires or gnawing
strips of jerked meat were making their own camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
near at hand. Darkly tanned, long-haired, broad-shouldered
men were they, the majority heavily
bearded. They moved lithely in moccasins, their buckskin
suits were patched and stained, they scarcely
stirred without rifle in hollow of arm, their belts bore
pistol or pair of pistols, and knife; their talk was a
curious jargon, but very expressive, and they themselves
were exceedingly business-like.</p>

<p>But the wonderful Kit Carson, famous hunter and
Indian fighter—was that really he? Of course, everybody
on the Santa Fé Trail knew about Kit Carson,
the free-trapper and captain of trappers, who as merely
a boy had made such a name for himself in the mountains
and who recently had come out of them, to live
at <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Fernandez de Taos</span> and to supply meat for Bent’s
Fort, north. Ere leaving the Missouri frontier little
Oliver had heard of Kit Carson as though he were ten
feet tall and four feet wide, and bore a pine-tree for a
club; but now little Oliver beheld an ordinary-looking
person, not much taller than himself and not nearly
so tall as many of the other trappers; with wiry body,
bandy legs, flat features, and a voice so ridiculously
low that his present conversation with Captain Blunt
did not carry beyond the camp-fire light.</p>

<p>Murmured comment by teamsters, here and there
among the wagons, showed to Oliver that he was not
alone in his disappointment.</p>

<p>“That’s Kit Carson, is it?”</p>

<p>“That leetle feller, with the captain yon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, naow, I thought Kit Carson war some
punkins!”</p>

<p>“A big Injun’s liable to pick him right up!”</p>

<p>“Whar’s his whiskers?”</p>

<p>But Dan Matthews, Captain Blunt’s first lieutenant,
came hurrying, from point to point in the circle.</p>

<p>“Turn out your critters, men; and you guards
post yourselves as before. Lively. There’s likely no
danger to-night, Carson says; but keep your eyes and
ears open, jest the same.”</p>

<p>“Is that thar reely Kit Carson—that leetle chap?”
queried Teamster Henry, as the camp bustled to resume
its routine.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Henry grunted.</p>

<p>“Wall, he’s the smallest pea for the amount of pod
ever <em>I</em> see!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be fooled, Henry,” retorted Lieutenant
Matthews. “You wait a bit, and if you don’t find
that he’s got the biggest <em>do</em> for the size of his <em>tell</em>
that ever you ran across, I’ll eat my hat.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” affirmed “Dutch” Jake, overhearing.
“Brag’s a good dog but he won’t fight; an’
you mustn’t jedge a race-hoss by the color of his hide.
You’re seeing one Kit Carson, a gentle-speaking,
mild-appearing, sort o’ nincompoop who you might
think didn’t know beans. But there’s another Kit
Carson, half hoss an’ half alligator, as they say on the
Mississippi, or half grizzly b’ar an’ half charging elk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as <em>I</em> say; an’ I reckon you’ll see him, too, ’fore we’re
through Injun country.”</p>

<p>These words of “Dutch” Jake impressed Oliver
deeply, for Jake spoke as if he knew. At any rate,
’twas pleasant to have the reinforcements: to watch
their easy figures, to hear their voices, to stroll through
their camp and catch their conversation, to note their
fringed, beaded clothing, their worn weapons, and
their wildly shaggy faces; and to feel their presence, so
handy, when in the darkness the fires died and both
camps went to sleep.</p>

<p>All the next day the march proceeded, southward
from the Arkansas, amidst sand hills and sparse vegetation.
The trappers from Taos rode in a line along
either side of the train, with scouts ahead and out
upon the flanks. The men of the train laughed and
talked, bantering back and forth. And behind, in the
reek of the procession, boy Oliver, ragged and upon his
old mule, driving the cavvy, strained eye and ear to
keep tab upon what was being done and said. At the
noon camp he had opportunity to scan, close by daylight,
Kit Carson again.</p>

<p>Kit Carson proved to have a square face, rugged
and weather-beaten, with sandy moustache, and
framed in long brown hair combed smoothly down behind
the ears. His cheek-bones were high, somewhat
Indian-like, his forehead was high and full, his mouth
straight and his chin firm. His most remarkable
feature was his eyes—wide apart, level-set, and of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
intense steely gray that fairly bored a hole where they
looked. His movements were quick and sure; and
how he stuck to a horse!</p>

<p>Oliver the more believed that “Dutch” Jake and
Lieutenant Matthews both knew better than Henry
and the other grumblers. Something about Kit
Carson said so.</p>

<p>Despite the rough joking, the march was an earnest
one. No straggling was permitted, to shoot antelope
or elk. Yet the day was not uneventful, for once
a great brown-bearded man—his beard reaching
almost to his belt—who was Solomon Silver, a Carson
man, dropping back, rode beside the cavvy until,
having good-naturedly eyed Oliver, he joined him, to
query, perhaps as a joke:</p>

<p>“Wall, boy; what’d ye reckon to do if the Injuns
come down sudden?”</p>

<p>“I’d fight ’em,” said Oliver, bravely. “Here’s my
pistol. See?”</p>

<p>“Haw! Haw!” boomed Sol Silver the trapper,
in a rousing laugh; and behind his beard he chuckled.
“That’s right, boy. Let’s see that shooting-iron o’
yorn,” and he laid it in the palm of his scarred hand.
“No use o’ Kit an’ us a-riding the trail, when this air
riding it too. I’ll tell him. ’Spec’ if you shoot an
Injun with this, son, an’ he gets to find out, he’d be
powerful mad at ye! But thar, boy; do yore best.
Hyar’s ’nother kind o’ pistol. Ever see one?” And
he pulled it from his buffalo-hide belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” confessed Oliver.</p>

<p>It was an odd-looking pistol, with long barrel and
a round bulge between barrel and stock.</p>

<p>“That air a pistol to shoot six times without reloading,”
declared Sol. “It has one barrel an’ six
chambers, in this cylinder; the barrel stays put, but the
cylinder turns ’round, with a fresh load ready, whenever
trigger air pulled. Wagh! It air made by a man
named Colt, in the States; it air called Colt, but it air
a full-size hoss.”</p>

<p>“Have you all got them?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“All we Carson men have ’em, an’ percussion-cap
rifles, to boot. When Kit Carson goes into a fight, he
goes in to win, an’ the best weapons air none too good
for his men. We air Carson men.” Sol proclaimed
this with a certain degree of pride.</p>

<p>“Will the Kiowas attack us, sure?” invited
Oliver.</p>

<p>“’Bout to-morrow, Kit thinks. When they do,
you give us fellows a chance ’fore you open up with
yore battery an’ take all the scalps.”</p>

<p>But Oliver suspected that Sol was joking again.
Still, he liked this jovial, burly Sol Silver, and hoped
that he <em>would</em> tell Kit Carson.</p>

<p>Nothing especial happened this night in camp, save
that Captain Blunt and lieutenants passed about, examining
all the guns and asking if powder-horns were
full. But at the breaking of camp, in the dawn, when
the wagons were forming to pull out in the double-column,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
something very especial happened. Behold,
into every wagon climbed a trapper or two, and stowed
themselves safely away amidst the goods under the protective
canvas hoods! Just a corner of the canvas
was left looped up a few inches, as if for air.</p>

<p>Now throughout the caravan eddied a gale of jeer
and derision and protest.</p>

<p>“This is the way they ride the trail with us, is it!”</p>

<p>“These ain’t mountain-men; they’re gophers!”</p>

<p>“Have we got to haul ’em an’ fight for ’em,
both?”</p>

<p>Even Kit Carson had disappeared, for cover. But
no response was made by the trappers; Captain Blunt
and his assistants bade the teamsters “Ketch up!”
and straighten out, for the march; and two by two on
rolled the wagons, the teamsters angry, the trappers
comfortably inside, and the trappers’ horses tethered
to the end-gates.</p>

<p>The action on the part of the trappers seemed as
strange to boy Oliver as it did to the teamsters. Was
that how Kit Carson men battled—by hiding behind
other men, and by crawling under cover and making
the people they were pretending to defend fight outside?
Humph! Maybe this wasn’t Kit Carson, after
all.</p>

<p>The sand-hills were increasing in number and extent;
dusty and dry was the way but nobody could
drink, for it was against orders to drink out of the
casks, or to fill canteens except once a day. The “dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
march” of over fifty miles was beginning, and sometimes
water gave out before it was traversed. So
every drop must be cherished.</p>

<p>With the hot sun about two hours high the caravan
was entering upon a long, rather narrow swale leading
between rounded sand-ridges whereon only cactus and
a few sprawly weeds grew. Captain Blunt and several
other riders were in advance; out upon the right
flank, and somewhat in advance rode Lieutenant Dan
Matthews and two men, and similarly upon the left
flank rode another wagon-train lieutenant. They
climbed hill after hill, and ridge after ridge, and surveyed
closely the country. As a rear-guard, behind
even Oliver, rode a squad of half-a-dozen traders and
free-lances. Thus the caravan was apparently well
provided against surprise; and as evidently the Kiowas
were thought to be near at hand, the rear-guard gave
Oliver a more comfortable feeling.</p>

<p>If the train must take care of itself, with those
trappers cravenly putting greater store on their own
hides than on the purpose for which they had pretended
to join, then the more precautions the better.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>UNDER THE WAGON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>How quietly wound the train, between the low
dun hills! No lashes cracked, no voices shouted, mule,
ox and horse steadily plodded, and the only sounds
were the subdued words of the teamsters encouraging
their animals, and the creaking of the dry wagon-frames.
But hark! Right in the midst of this brooding
atmosphere drifted down from the hills upon the
right a rifle-report; and when Oliver caught sight of
the place, here came, full tilt, from flankers’ duty, Dan
and his comrades; behind them the smoke of the report
was still wafting.</p>

<p>“Injuns!” This was the alarm. Instantly the
caravan was again in a frenzy of commotion. Teamsters
curled their lashes and sent their mules into a
lope, their oxen into a lumbering trot; loud rose a
medley of exclamations, orders, rumbling of wheels.
From behind little Oliver, who, his heart in his mouth,
was shouting at his lazy cavvy, urging them forward
(Oh, such a long way must he go!), rode for him the
rear-guard.</p>

<p>“Quick! Roust these critters!” they bade, one to
another, and helped him. The cavvy was forced into
a trot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>From right and left and before, the flankers and
van-guard were hustling in, bending low and lashing
their horses. Now another report of rifle drifted in;
another, and another! Barely pausing in their mad
flight, Dan and his two comrades were turning in saddle
and aiming to their rear; jets of white smoke sped
from the muzzles of their guns, as one after another
they fired. For there were the Indians—issuing from
the crest of the sand-ridge, as if springing out of holes,
and pouring over, down the slope, trying to catch Dan
and the other men. They must be Indians, because
they flourished lances, and because they were naked,
with feathers streaming in the breeze.</p>

<p>But they couldn’t overtake Dan and his men.</p>

<p>Now from the opposite slope echoed more shots.
Indians here also! See them come, after that squad
of scouts! Why didn’t the trappers get out from the
wagons, and help? Why didn’t the cavvy travel
faster? What a lot of Indians! And would the
wagons be parked, in time, and would there be a hole
left for the cavvy? Supposing there wasn’t, and he,
Oliver, must stay outside!</p>

<p>“Roust those critters! Roust those critters!”
urged the men with Oliver, as in the dust and the
hubbub and the excitement they all shrieked together.</p>

<p>Almost crying, in his earnestness, little Oliver did
his best.</p>

<p>As fast as they arrived at trot and gallop the
wagons swung to right and to left, tongues inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
front wheels locked with hind wheels of the previously
arrived, the teams were unhitched, the teamsters knelt
to thrust their yagers between the spokes and aim.
Smaller and smaller grew the opening, as the oval
closed—but amidst yell and murk, in through the
opening galloped at last the cavvy, and like the rest
little Oliver, breathless, gasping, found himself
“forted.”</p>

<p>None too soon was it! Down streamed, on either
flank, the foe—a hideously screaming, whooping,
feathered, painted foe: riding, many of them bridleless,
most of them garmentless, brandishing tufted lance
and strung bow, with here and there a gun, face and
body daubed lavishly with red and yellow.</p>

<p>“Kiowas!” ran through the wagon-fort the muttered
exclamation. And——</p>

<p>“Get out o’ there, you trappers! You Kit Carson
men!” rose the angry cry. “Get out o’ yore holes
an’ show what you can do!”</p>

<p>But from within the wagons answered never a
sound nor a stir.</p>

<p>However, ’twas no time nor place, now, to berate
the dastard mountain-men, so false to their reputation.
The teamsters were green; the wagon-fort had been
poorly formed, in the haste; the location was bad,
for defense; and darting from wagon to wagon, along
the circle, Captain Blunt and other leaders besought
the defenders to keep cool and hold their fire.</p>

<p>The painted Kiowas on-rushed as if they were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ride right over the wagons! “Bang!” spoke the
yager of a teamster. And “Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bangity-bang!” bellowed the smooth-bores as
his excited mates pulled triggers. In vain Captain
Blunt and his aides ran, ordered, implored, threatened.
The Kiowas were two hundred yards away; too far
for a clumsy yager—but at the volley every one fell
from his horse. Were they all killed? Were they?
Hurrah, thought little Oliver. No—a fellow in bright
yellow leggins was left! But at the “pop!” of little
Oliver’s pistol he, also, fell over! Then——</p>

<p>No! More were left, on this side; and on the other
side! See? Even the yellow-leggins had come to life.
Saddle-pad after saddle-pad miraculously grew a
figure, and on dashed the Kiowas again, as many as
ever, with joyous yelps charging empty guns. That
was what they had hoped for—empty guns.</p>

<p>Realizing, the panicky teamsters fumbled and made
mistakes, as rattling their pieces among the wagon-spokes
they would pour powder, ram ball, prime pan,
cock, aim, fire. Disdaining to hang now by thong-loops
upon the opposite side of their horses, with bows
drawn, lances poised, and a gun or two speaking, the
wild redmen of the sand-hills bore headlong for the
weakly answering caravan.</p>

<p>So swiftly they neared! Ere half the yagers had
been reloaded they were within fifty yards. Could
anything stop them? With thud upon thud their
arrows pelted in and through. Their paint patterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
were plain, their faces glared, their guttural exclamations
could be heard—and boy Oliver, with one last
frantic glance about, dived under a low-hung wagon.</p>

<p>Even as he did so, he heard a new sound. It was
not “Bang!” and “Bang!” It was “Spat!” “Spat!
Spat!” and “Whing!” The wagon over him
swayed, a fresh fume of powder-smoke floated to his
nostrils. The trappers! He had forgotten the trappers!
They had fired, at last, from beneath the wagon-covers—but
they were too late.</p>

<p>It seemed to little Oliver that he waited a long
time for the charge. He still heard the whoops and
grunts of the Kiowas, right at hand—they were coming,
coming, coming! They would scalp the whole
caravan, and steal all the cavvy! And while he waited,
clutching his pistol, another sound arose. Inside the
wagon-fort was a new commotion—a clamor of voices,
a shuffling of hasty feet, a rattle of stirrup and a thud
of many hoofs!</p>

<p>Had the Kiowas broken through? They must!
The wagon over him swayed again, something struck
it, almost shoved it to one side; he peered, craning
his neck to see into the dust—and a set of hoofs passed
right over his head. He glimpsed a buckskin rider,
on the <em>outside</em>; a trapper had forced his horse between
the loosely locked wheels of the two wagons, and was
on the <em>outside</em>!</p>

<p>The Kiowas were here, too. Many were upon the
ground, and the red which stained them was redder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
than the red of vermilion paint. Yes, many and
many were upon the ground. But the others were
charging about; little Oliver had not been waiting long,
after all. He knelt, trembling in his eagerness. There
were still a host of Kiowas, and they were very angry.
The wagon-fort must be fairly oozing trappers,
mounted; for from either direction they were galloping
into the field, their lines loose, their buckskin-clad,
fringed bodies leaning forward, pistol in hand.</p>

<p>Across the little space, to the line of prone and
doubled figures they raced. “Bang! Bang!” jetted
their pistols. The live Kiowas, dodging and hanging
to the necks of their ponies, parted before the counter-charge,
swerved at the volley, let the trappers into their
midst—and with a great savage yell of vengeance
turned, to close. For the trappers’ pistols were empty,
as the teamsters’ yagers had been! Now long scores
would be settled; a trapper’s scalp was worthy many a
dance.</p>

<p>But what a surprise! With “Bang! Bang!” the
pistols spoke again and yet again and again, and needed
no reloading! Down from their ponies plunged stricken
Kiowas, fierce career ended; around wheeled the unstricken,
lying low upon pony backs, hammering pony
sides with desperate heels, fleeing the wondrous medicine
of the whites. And through the lodges of plains
and desert spread the wail: “White man shoot one
time with rifle and six time with butcher-knife!” Thus
before the eyes of boy Oliver, under the wagon, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
broken by Kit Carson and his men the power of the
caravan pirates.</p>

<p>Cheering and lashing, the trappers made pursuit
clear out of sight. All around the wagon-fort the
battle had resulted the same. With that result the
teamsters really had little to do, after their first ineffective
volley; and they could only stare, open-mouthed,
when so unexpectedly the trapper rifles emptied the
saddle-pads in earnest, and without hesitation out the
trappers charged. They still were staring, scarcely
crediting, when back the trappers rode, in little squads,
grim and weary, but not without their banter. Slipped
under the belts they brought scalps. Oliver saw Sol
Silver, and he recognized others—and he found Kit
Carson.</p>

<p>Kit Carson chanced to ride close in, past Oliver’s
wagon, and paused here to shake hands with Captain
Blunt. His face was flushed and his lips tight together;
and his eyes! They were terrible eyes, not
now steel-gray but a vivid blue, flaming like living
amethysts or like blue stars.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said, in reply to Captain Blunt’s
congratulations. “<a href="#i_frontis">We taught those thar red demons
a lesson they’ll not forget.</a> It’s all over. Go ahead
with yore caravan.”</p>

<p>Hearing, Oliver shame-facedly crawled out from
beneath the wagon; and it seemed to him that Kit
Carson the Great saw him, and smiled friendly at him.</p>

<p>Some of the teamsters would have liked to mingle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with the trappers and to rehearse what had been done,
and what had not been done, and what might have
been done, in the short fight; but “Catch up! Ketch
up!” and “Fall in, men!” rang the sharp orders of
the caravan officers. Time had been lost, water was
dwindling, every moment was precious; the march
must proceed at once.</p>

<p>So team after team settled to collar and yoke,
wagon after wagon lurched forward; and presently
little Oliver was once more in the rear of all, driving
his cavvy through the drifting dust. Strangely
enough, not a man of caravan or trappers had been
wounded, and only one mule had received an arrow,
in the hip.</p>

<p>“Wall, boy, how’d you like the Kiowas?” It was
Sol Silver, again, back beside Oliver. Brown-bearded
and burly, he looked the same as ever and as if he had
not been in any fight. But tucked in his belt were two
scalps. “Whar’s yore pelts for trophies?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any. I wasn’t close enough,” answered
Oliver, truthfully.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I see you chasing the chief on yore mule?”
invited Sol. “Kit took one chief an’ you took t’other.”</p>

<p>Oliver flushed, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I didn’t try.”</p>

<p>“Whar war ye, then?”</p>

<p>Oliver flushed more and hung his head.</p>

<p>“Under a wagon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Haw! Haw!” roared Sol, and chuckled through
his beard. “What war the matter?”</p>

<p>Oliver wanted to cry.</p>

<p>“I guess I was afraid.”</p>

<p>“Haw! Haw!” roared Sol. “Guess mebbe you
war.” Then he sobered. “You fetched yore cavvy
in, though, I hear tell.”</p>

<p>“Men helped me.”</p>

<p>“But you come in behind an’ not ahead, jest the
same,” asserted Sol. “That war right. Warn’t ye
afraid the Injuns’d get ye, ’fore you war forted?”</p>

<p>Oliver nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s right,” said Sol. “You corralled
yore cavvy fust, an’ then you crawled under
the wagon. Don’t blame ye for being afraid. Only
a fool’s never afraid. Being afraid doesn’t make anybody
a coward. I ’spec’ you thought us trappers war
afraid, too, when we crawled into the wagons, ’fore
you crawled under one.”</p>

<p>Oliver must nod again.</p>

<p>“We warn’t; not this time. But I reckon we’ve
all been afraid, many another time. This time we
crawled into the wagons so the Injuns wouldn’t see
us. If the Injuns spied Kit Carson men riding with a
wagon-train they’d never attack, you bet. These
Southwest Injuns know us Kit Carson men by sight,
now. An’ you jest say ‘Kit Carson’ to ’em, an’ out
comes the peace-pipe mighty quick. They can depend
on Kit to fight ’em if they’re bound to fight, or to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
straight with ’em if they want to talk straight. He
air a bad enemy, an’ he air a best friend. He shoots
plumb centre, with both tongue an’ rifle.”</p>

<p>The noon camp was very brief; long enough only
for the animals to breathe, and for the men to munch
a strip each of dried meat, while coffee boiled. But it
was long enough for Oliver to sidle near where Kit
Carson appeared to be telling stories to a group of
caravan men. Anybody should know that Kit Carson
must have marvellous stories to tell.</p>

<p>“But what about that time you sneaked on hands
an’ knees, through the snow, close to the Injun fort,
near head o’ the Arkansas, an’ cut the hosses loose an’
drove ’em off with snow-balls?” asked Teamster
Henry.</p>

<p>“When war that?” inquired Kit Carson, as if
mildly surprised.</p>

<p>“Some years back. When you fust went into the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Kit Carson, slowly rubbing his chin.
“That war some o’ Captain Gant’s men. Captain
Gant had lost some hosses, by these Crows, an’ his
men went an’ got ’em. Can’t do without hosses, in the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“But weren’t you along?”</p>

<p>“Wall, I might have followed,” drawled Carson,
uneasily. “I don’t exactly remember ’bout that. They
war brave fellows, though. They——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reckon you’ve made a heap o’ Injuns run, all
the same,” interrupted an admiring caravaner.</p>

<p>“Sartinly, sartinly,” agreed Kit Carson. “Part
the time I’ve been running after them, an’ most the
time they’ve been running after <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“You gave ’em a good dose this time, though.”</p>

<p>“Wall, we had to; we had to. My men had to,”
declared Kit Carson, and he brought down his clenched
hand. “But we didn’t like to; that is, we oughtn’t
to like to. Nobody likes to kill human beings; an’
these Injuns, pore critters, ain’t been raised to know
any better’n to rob an’ murder. They think this hyar’s
their country, an’ we whites air using up the game they
depend on. But o’ course, these Kiowas come down
’specting to wipe out a defenceless train that warn’t
doing ’em any harm, an’ we simply <em>had</em> to shoot into
’em. If this caravan didn’t lick ’em, proper, some
other caravan must. Now the job’s over.”</p>

<p>“How many did you kill, of ’em? You got the
chief, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Me?” queried Kit Carson, again mildly surprised.
“Oh, thar war jest a lot o’ shooting an’ riding
around, an’ we did the best we could. We war lucky
to have these six-shooter pistols—revolvers, they call
’em. Ever see ’em before?”</p>

<p>“You’ll never get him to talk about himself,”
warned a trapper to a listener near Oliver. “Sometimes
he will, with Injuns, ’cause they understand
boasting, an’ they all know Kit Carson. But ’tain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
white man way with him. So you might as well quit.
He hates the leetle letter ‘I.’”</p>

<p>“That’s heap weepon, shorely,” commented a teamster,
examining. “Beats the big gun of that boy,
yonder.”</p>

<p>Now, this caused everybody to look at Oliver,
which was most embarrassing. He was well aware
that his little pistol was not so grand as these new-style
revolvers; and he did not like to be laughed at.
But Kit Carson, as if glad to change the subject from
himself, smiled and said quickly:</p>

<p>“Hello, boy. You’re safe, they say, an’ so’s yore
cavvy. You’ll make a warrior yet.”</p>

<p>Oliver must hang his head and turn and twist.
He didn’t deserve such praise.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I crawled under a wagon,” he
blurted. “I didn’t fight any.”</p>

<p>“Haw! Haw!” rose the laughter.</p>

<p>“Wall,” remarked Kit Carson, quietly, but clearly,
“I’ve seen many a time when I wished I war under a
wagon, myself.”</p>

<p>At this moment “Catch up! Ketch up!” sounded
the calls, and the talk must end, while the caravan
resumed the trail.</p>

<p>Not another Indian came into sight, as the train
plodded on, with the Kit Carson men still acting as
escort. At sunset camp was made for the night, beside
a dried water-course where grew a few hardy
cottonwoods. Sitting wearily his old mule, watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
his cavvy until the night guard should relieve him,
little Oliver wished that he was by one of the trappers’
mess-fires instead, where Kit Carson might smile upon
him, again. However, while he sat upon the mule,
a figure rode to him, through the dusk. It was the
booming Sol Silver, once more. Sol spoke direct.</p>

<p>“Boy, Kit sent me to ask how’d you like to go on
to Touse with us, ’stead o’ to Santy Fee with the
caravan?”</p>

<p>Oliver gasped.</p>

<p>“Can I? With you!”</p>

<p>“If you want to, an’ if Kit decides so. We take
the Touse trail in the morning. Now, if you’re to
come, thar’ll be a fire made at the foot o’ that thar cottonwood,
standing out alone. See it? Wall, if you
see the flare, pretty soon, you’ll know. But you’ll lose
yore wages from the caravan. They’ll not pay ye
less you go through to Santy Fee with ’em.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” stammered Oliver. “I’d rather go
to Touse, with you. Can I be a Kit Carson man?”</p>

<p>“Reckon you can, some time, if you got it in you;
an’ if Kit thinks you have, you have. All right; don’t
say anything, an’ watch for the fire.”</p>

<p>Sol rode back to his mates. Oliver watched
anxiously. Hurrah, the fire flared, just as he was
trudging to supper. And when, in the morning, caravan
and trappers parted company, into the west on the
Taos trail rode with the Kit Carson men little Oliver
Wiggins.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br />
<small>OLIVER WINS HIS SPURS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That evening, with clatter of hoof and volley of
victorious whoops and rifle-shots, amidst the sunset
they galloped into the New Mexican village of Don
Fernandez de Taos, sixty miles west from where they
had parted with the Santa Fé bound caravan.</p>

<p>Taos, or “old Touse,” as it was affectionately
styled, lies in a mountain valley eighty miles north of
Santa Fé. Here had his home and headquarters Kit
Carson, captain over his company of forty-five trappers.
He lived in one of the box-like clay houses, with
his little daughter Adaline. Adaline, four years old,
was a dark, elfish lass, half Indian; for her mother, Kit
Carson’s wife, had been an Arapahoe. Kit had married
this Arapahoe in the mountains, in the summer of 1835,
but she had died soon after the birth of little Adaline.</p>

<p>“Kit thought a heap o’ Alice,” declared Sol Silver,
to Oliver. “Some trappers jest take a squaw as cook
an’ lodge cleaner, an’ all that. But Kit air true man.
He named his squaw Alice, an’ when she died he felt
mighty bad. He’s got that gal to raise, now.”</p>

<p>The Kit Carson company of trappers were divided
into two bands, under Lieutenant Ike Chamberlain and
Lieutenant Sol Silver. They took turns going upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
excursions after beaver—or sometimes they all were
out together.</p>

<p>Besides the beaver-hunting, there was the buffalo-hunting
for Bent’s Fort. Northeast of Taos, 250
and more miles, upon the Arkansas River in southern
Colorado of to-day, was the large clay-built trading-post
of Bent’s Fort, or Fort William, its hardy garrison
trafficking with 20,000 wild Cheyennes, Utes, and
Arapahoes.</p>

<p>Kit Carson had the contract for supplying the
garrison with meat. So twice a year, in spring and in
fall, the Carson men gathered at Bent’s Fort, for a
great buffalo-hunt. Into the fort were brought thousands
of pounds of buffalo-meat.</p>

<p>The great Kit Carson did not seem to think much
of Oliver, after landing him in Taos. He gave him
a place to sleep and a place at table; but he did not
send him out to trap beaver, or hunt buffalo, or rescue
traders. He put him upon the shabby mule, and set
him at his old job of tending a horse-herd.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, boy,” consoled Sol Silver, when
Oliver would complain. “You do well what’s yores
to be done, an’ chance at more will come.”</p>

<p>The extra horses and mules belonging to the Kit
Carson company were pastured in the open on the outskirts
of town. Every morning they must be driven
out to graze, and every evening they must be brought
back to the corral. It was Oliver’s business to drive
them out and to drive them back—which he did with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
many shouts and much rope-waving and gallant racing
by his ancient mule. Thus for a year he was the
official herder for the Carson company.</p>

<p>The Carson men came and went. Oliver heard
their stories, of stirring deeds by themselves or by Bill
Williams, Jim Bridger, Captain Billy Sublette, and
others; and by Kit Carson. On the other hand, he
never heard “Kit” (as his friends lovingly called
him) make much mention of himself in any adventures;
somebody else always was the hero.</p>

<p>When home in Taos Kit played much with his
swarthy little daughter, Adaline. Just what to do
with her appeared to bother him. Oliver once noted
him saying, in his soft voice, with broad accent of the
South and the border mingled:</p>

<p>“I war raised without schooling; then I ran away
an’ I war twelve years on the trail an’ in the mountains
’fore I came out to Bent’s an’ to Taos again.
Now I’m thirty-two, an’ without any education ’cept
trapper education. ’Tisn’t human for a man not to be
able to read or write; an’ what I’m to do with my leetle
gal I don’t know. But I want her to have education.”</p>

<p>This seemed to Oliver rather a queer idea from the
great Kit Carson, who could shoot and ride and trail
and talk Indian talk and make Indian sign, besides
speaking a rude Spanish and some French. Why
should such a man care to read and write, or wish
that his children should read and write? But Kit
Carson had been much in earnest, nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Now was it the late fall of 1841, and Oliver still
was the official herder for the Carson company. However,
he had grown very much during these twelve
months in the fresh air, riding and tramping and doing
man’s work. Tough of muscle and sturdy of frame,
he was becoming full-chested like Kit Carson himself.
But he could not yet be called a trapper.</p>

<p>The men were kind to him; he liked them; he
stood their joking and their rough ways, and tried to
do what they told him was best to do. So they apparently
liked him, in turn, and would teach him how to
shoot quick and straight, and to ride easily and surely.</p>

<p>On this, an afternoon in the last week of November,
he had been permitted by Lieutenant Ike Chamberlain
(a stalwart six-footer was Ike, and a tremendous
fighter, they all said) to take out upon herd Ike’s
favorite rifle—a heavy flint-lock, made by the celebrated
gun-smith Hawkins, of St. Louis. It was taller
than Oliver, and the long barrel was so heavy that
he scarcely could hold it out; so when he shot it he
rested it upon brush, or crossed sticks, or whatever
else was handy. But the bullet sped true to the sight.
“Plumb centre” shot a Hawkins rifle.</p>

<p>With the heavy rifle balanced across his lap, with
buffalo-horn powder-flask and beaded hide bullet-pouch
slung from his shoulders, and with broad, keen skinning-knife
belted by hide belt at his right thigh, he
was prepared to shoot rabbits. Obeying instructions
of Ike and Sol and the other men, he had learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hit the rabbits only in the head. It was fairer to the
rabbit, for the rabbit had more chance of escape by
being missed. To hit a rabbit in the body was scorned
by mountain-men, and was deemed careless, slovenly
work.</p>

<p>Bearing thirteen rabbits shot each through the head
by single ball from the flint-lock Hawkins mountain
rifle, Oliver proudly drove the Carson “cavvy” home
at evening. Laden like valiant hunter he trudged
through the village, to exhibit his spoils—and to get
his supper.</p>

<p>He found Taos stirred by excitement. Several
strange teamsters were forming centres of little groups
of listeners. These were Santa Fé caravan teamsters;
they had sought Taos to report that between Taos
and Santa Fé a band of Indians had stampeded fourteen
span of their mules, and to ask help from the Kit
Carson men.</p>

<p>At an unfortunate moment had the teamsters
applied for the succor. Trappers were out upon the
final fur hunt of the year; a buffalo hunt for Bent’s
Fort was in progress; Ike Chamberlain had ridden
away that morning, upon errand bound; and Kit Carson
was temporarily pallet-laid by reason of a pistol
wound through the left leg. His new Colt’s revolving
pistol had fallen from his belt, and striking upon its
hammer had discharged its ball diagonally through
between knee and ankle.</p>

<p>As for the other men in Taos, they were slothful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Mexican loungers, not at all of a spirit to help the
Americans fight the Indians. “Let the Americans do
their own fighting,” they said; “we want only to be let
alone.”</p>

<p>Kit Carson was much perturbed, half sitting, restlessly,
on his couch of blankets and robes.</p>

<p>“What you got thar, boy?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Rabbits. I shot every one in the head,” informed
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Let me see ’em.”</p>

<p>Oliver brought in the bunch, and threw it down
before Kit Carson, who explored it with his sound
foot.</p>

<p>“Wall!” he mused, slowly. “A lad who can
shoot like that needn’t herd cavvy. It’s time you went
on the hunt. I’ll put a Mexican at herding.” Oliver’s
heart leaped gladly. Kit Carson fidgeted, ill at ease,
and continued: “Now those teamsters have come in,
expecting us to help ’em get back their stolen critters,
an’ I haven’t got a single man to send out after the
red rascals. An’ hyar I’m laid up, myself! What do
you think, boy? You know the country. Do you
reckon you could take these fellows an’ help ’em get
back their critters, if I told you exactly whar to go?”</p>

<p>Oliver nodded. His eyes were big, his heart
thumped in his throat so that at last he could only
stammer:</p>

<p>“I’ll try. I guess I could. I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” said Kit, still restless, “nobody can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
more than try. An’ hyar’s a chance for you at mountain-man
work. ’Less I’m much mistaken, those red
rascals air making straight for——” and he described
to Oliver a well-known box-canyon or enclosed pocket,
among the hills 150 miles westward. Oliver nodded;
he had been that far, once, upon a little trip with Kit
Carson, and he remembered the trail. “They’ll take
the critters thar an’ hide ’em; an’ now they won’t be
expecting pursuit. With everybody fresh mounted,
if you leave right after eating this evening you ought
to get thar to-morrow evening, so as to rush the camp
in ’arly morning. Pick a good hoss out o’ the cavvy,
for yoreself. Fust go get something to eat. Thar
come some o’ the men; I’ll tell ’em what we’re to do.”</p>

<p>Treading air and vastly excited, himself, Oliver
sped away to make his preparations.</p>

<p>“Better fill yore powder flask, boy,” called Kit,
kindly. “Help yoreself from my horn, yonder. An’
thar’s the bullets. They fit Ike’s gun. But don’t
shoot ’less you have to; an’ if you do shoot, shoot
as straight as if you war shooting rabbits. Remember,
it air the bullets that hit that count.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I’ll remember,” engaged Oliver, working
eagerly.</p>

<p>So presently into the twilight glow rode the dozen
teamsters, armed and mounted as well as practicable.
Two and two they rode: their bearded, booted, flannel-shirted
captain, and ragged Oliver high on a yellow
horse, side by side in the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the twilight, and through the gloaming,
and through the starry night, at trot broken by now
and then a brief space of walk, westward rode the
little cavalcade, to surprise the Apaches.</p>

<p>The dark blue sky gradually paled; paled the dusky
earth; coyotes homeward slinked; little brown birds
twittered amidst the brush; from the east spread upward
a pink radiance; and stiff and chilled from the
night’s travel through the great open sage country, at
rising of the sun the pursuit jogged into the first of
the hill defiles.</p>

<p>As they rode, the horsemen ate; chewing at strips
of dried buffalo meat.</p>

<p>Higher and more numerous waxed the hills, their
long steep slopes covered with chaparral and stunted
timber, and separated by bouldered water-courses,
many of them dry. The trail seemed a blind one.</p>

<p>“Do ye know whar you’re going, boy?” queried
the teamster captain, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve been in here before, and Kit Carson
told me,” answered Oliver, hard at work thinking,
and peering keenly.</p>

<p>At noon they rested by a stream, and let the horses
graze, and dozed, themselves, while down upon the
wild maze of quiet wooded hills poured the generous
sun—his beams hot in the thin atmosphere.</p>

<p>After their nooning, again they rode. The country
had grown wilder; the hills had become peaks,
snow-capped; the water-courses had cut deep gulches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and canyons. It was the favorite region of the Jicarilla
(Heek-ah-ree-yah, <i>i.e.</i>, Basket) Apaches; the
ancient volcano land of northern New Mexico west
of the Rio Grande. Here the Jicarillas had their
retreats.</p>

<p>Now the pursuit must ride more carefully, for
Oliver was not certain but that they might be near the
Indians. So they scanned every ridge to catch timely
glimpse of Indian scout, and every hollow to catch
glimpse of tell-tale smoke. An oddly-shaped little
peak was the landmark; and as by way of draw and
pass, from valley to valley, they neared it, Oliver’s
heart beat faster. Below the peak was that box-canyon
or enclosed basin where, according to Kit Carson’s
judgment, the stolen stock would be hidden.</p>

<p>At last the wearied little cavalcade wound around
a wooded shoulder and could scan the spot where lay
the outlaw refuge. Up-wafted lazily, as from the basin
itself, into the sunset atmosphere above the fringing
trees and rocks, a film of hazy blue smoke. Indian
camp!</p>

<p>However, too late was it, this day, to attack; darkness
would interfere. So the pursuit rode nearer, and
sent two men forward afoot to spy. They left; and
they returned, scratched and grimy, in the dusk, to
report that a Jicarilla camp was located in the basin,
that the Indians were gorging and making merry
around a fire, and that more than fourteen span of
mules, evidently stolen, were grazing freely, hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not nor tethered, upon the grass of the secluded niche.
Having driven their spoil 150 miles into the heart of
the Apache mountains, the Indians evidently were
expecting no interference.</p>

<p>And here, likewise 150 miles from white settlement,
the pursuit grimly squatted down to a fireless
night and a long wait until dawn. They slept at intervals;
even Oliver slept, exultant though he was at
having led true, and anxious though he was for further
results.</p>

<p>The dawn grayed; the men stiffly stirred about,
saddling their hunched horses and priming afresh their
weapons.</p>

<p>“Let the boy show the trail,” bade the teamster
leader, gruffly. “He’s been hyar’bouts before, he
says.”</p>

<p>Oliver was nothing loth; Kit Carson had told him
exactly where to strike the one entrance into the basin—the
one entrance which also was the one exit. Therefore,
carrying the Ike Chamberlain rifle in approved
fashion in hollow of left arm, ready, Oliver forced
his yellow horse into the advance.</p>

<p>“When we charge, everybody yell ‘Kit Carson!
Kit Carson!’” he proposed, huskily. “When they
hear that they’ll run, sure. They’re afraid of Kit
Carson.”</p>

<p>The teamster leader gravely nodded; and down the
dim file, following the yellow horse, was passed the
word: “Yell ‘Kit Carson’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The mist of dawn enveloped the world, and lay
moist upon twig and leaf. In silence the single file
threaded the pines; the moist carpeting of needles gave
no sound. Into a gravelly draw through which ran
a newly hoof-cut trail they rode; boulders closed about
them; a stream flowed past for the outer country;
they quickened their pace to a trot; and, every rifle
poised, at a gallop they poured through the narrow
entrance and charged across the open park inside.</p>

<p>“Kit Carson! Kit Carson!” shrilled little Oliver,
excitedly hammering with his moccasined heels the
flanks of his yellow horse.</p>

<p>“Kit Carson! Kit Carson!” welled hoarsely the
chorus behind him.</p>

<p>Barked Apache dogs; snorted Apache pony and
stolen mule, stampeding here and there in the grayness.
Spreading, on left and right, the charging teamsters
overtook Oliver. Before, recumbent figures
around the smouldering fires had up-leaped, throwing
off blankets and robes, seizing weapons, hesitating, to
discharge hasty bullet or arrow, and at thud of hoof,
crack of rifle, and that terrible cry, “Kit Carson! Kit
Carson!” half-naked to flee, through the grayness—scurrying
across the level and scrambling amidst the
rocky walls.</p>

<p>“Whang!” spoke Oliver’s Ike Chamberlain rifle—its
butt half-way to his shoulder, its heavy muzzle
pointed out in the general direction of the rout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And “Whang!” “Bang!” spoke the pieces of
the teamsters.</p>

<p>Fleeing figures pitched headlong to the dewy
sward; from amidst the rocks of the crumbling, sheer
walls, where, at bay, they vainly answered with shot
and yell, others pitched headlong, or sank back, to be
still. While two or three of their number guarded the
exit, that the ponies and mules might not escape, the
teamsters charged on, searching the rocks with rifle
and pistol; and not an Indian of the eighteen thieving
warriors was left alive.</p>

<p>But young Oliver found that this was very different
from shooting at rabbits; and in after days he
never was certain whether he had killed all—or none.
However, he fired only the one shot; and at the close
of the battle he still was trying to reload!</p>

<p>In the sunrise, with eighteen ponies bearing Apache
brands or ear-marks, and with thirty-five mules and
horses bearing trader or trapper brands or ear-marks,
the triumphant little cavalcade rode out from the
trampled strong-hold, upon trail for Taos. Sharing
with the teamster leader the advance, Oliver sat
proudly his yellow horse. He had earned his place.</p>

<p>At the close of the second day they entered Taos.
Summoned by the great clatter of hoofs and the loud
volley of triumphant whoops, the villagers cheered.</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buen’ muchacho!</span>” praised the natives, calling
to Oliver: “Good boy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>And Oliver passed on, to share in the report by the
teamster captain at the house of Kit Carson.</p>

<p>Kit Carson said little, but his blue-gray eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>“Wall, I reckoned you’d find ’em thar,” he said,
from his couch against the wall. “Hyar, boy; fetch
me that gun yonder.”</p>

<p>Oliver brought over to him, from the corner, the
weapon. Kit Carson handed it back to him.</p>

<p>“Take it. It’s yores,” he said. “Now you’re
a mountain-man, an’ what’s a mountain-man without a
rifle? You’re a mountain-man an’ a Kit Carson man,
an’ it’s ’bout time you went on the trap trail. But,”
he added, with a twinkle, noting Oliver’s confusion,
“you’ll have time to eat, fust, an’ sleep.”</p>

<p>Clutching his treasure, and crowded with thanks
which he could not utter yet, Oliver staggered away.</p>

<p>Kit Carson’s rifle! Kit Carson’s own rifle! A rifle
better than even Ike Chamberlain’s; for Ike’s was a
flint-lock, whereas this, scarce a year old, was of the
convenient new percussion-cap invention, and had cost
sixty dollars, gold. Moreover, in the stock were nineteen
brass-headed tacks, stuck there by Kit Carson,
and each counting as an Indian scalp!</p>

<small>WORD FROM OLD FORT LARAMIE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Spring and the beaver-hunt season opened. The
whole Carson company organized for a trip far to the
north. Oliver was apportioned his dozen traps, and
his name was upon the pay-roll. The company left
early in March; but Ike Chamberlain was in charge,
for Kit Carson had astonished them all by announcing
that he was going to the States.</p>

<p>“It’s time my little gal had education,” he said,
quietly. “Touse or Bent’s air no place for her, or
Santy Fee either, an’ I’m no fit person to raise her.
I’ve got kin back thar in Missouri, an’ maybe I can
put her with some o’ them, so she’ll grow up with
white people an’ learn civilized ways.”</p>

<p>“Have you been back thar since you come out,
Kit?” asked somebody.</p>

<p>Carson shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he said; “in the sixteen years the only
settlements I’ve seen air trading posts o’ plains an’
mountains, an’ Touse an’ Santy Fee. I war a boy
when in fall o’ Twenty-six I left home. Ought to
have gone back, but didn’t. They say now Missouri’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
grown a heap, an’ I won’t know Franklin town, an’
thar’s so many other towns I’ll be lost.”</p>

<p>“Independence air the outfit point o’ the Santy
Fee caravans, now,” observed Ike Chamberlain—a
fact that all knew. “Franklin air too far down-river.
An’ thar’s a new movement on—to Oregon in the
Northwest country; starts from the Missouri at Independence
same as Santy Fee trade does. Those missionaries
who went out to the lower Columbia, over the
South Pass an’ the Snake River trail, in Thirty-four
an’ after, have been making big talks through the
States, ’bout how Oregon air the place for ’Merican
farmers ’stead o’ British fur-hunters, an’ Congress has
been argufying, an’ Lu has jest heard from some o’
his folks that thar’s a regular movement afoot this
spring to send a big wagon-train o’ settlers out by the
Platte an’ Laramie trail, over South Pass an’ clear
through to the Columbia. Isn’t that so, Lu?”</p>

<p>Lucien Maxwell nodded. He was a dark, broad-shouldered
young man, about twenty-three, and a
favorite of Kit Carson’s. He was not in the Carson
company, exactly, but was a trader with the Indians
and for the Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Co., on the Santa Fé
Trail and between Bent’s Fort and Fort St. Vrain. He
was much at Taos, where he had just married the
Señorita Luz Beaubien, daughter of Charles Beaubien,
one of Taos’ most cultured residents. As Maxwell was
much upon the trader trail to the States, and as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
lived, or at least his parents lived, at old Kaskaskia,
Illinois, below St. Louis, he carried much news.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “I’ve a letter and a newspaper
from home that say that Doctor White—Elijah
White, who’s been missionary doctor in Oregon; you
fellows have heard him—has been appointed Indian
agent for the United States in Oregon; and when he
goes out this spring a lot of settlers are going, too, so
as to have him take ’em through.”</p>

<p>“Wagh!” grunted an old trapper. “Fat doings
for Injuns! Thar’ll be hosses to steal an’ ha’r to lift,
I’m thinking. Sioux an’ Blackfeet air half-froze for
jest sech a caravan o’ greenhorns on a trail ’crost continent.
Wagh! This chile’d rather go it alone.”</p>

<p>“Thar ought to be a line o’ posts from the Missouri
clear to the mountains, all ’long the trail; an’ over
across, too, if folks from the States air going to travel
it,” declared Chamberlain.</p>

<p>“That ees so. Dose Injuns, dey get mad when dey
see so many whites in buffalo country; an’ dose Britishers
in Oregon, dey jus’ as soon Americans stay on
dees side Rocky Mountains,” agreed Mariano, Mexican
trapper.</p>

<p>“Well, this paper has a message in it from Washington,
and there’s talk of a government expedition
going out over the trail this very spring, to survey it
and maybe see what can be done,” informed Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Wagh!” grunted the old trapper. “Hyar’s
a coon that doesn’t need ary government expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to show <em>him</em> the trail. He travelled it with Ashley in
Twenty-four, he did; an’ he war over the South Pass
an’ into the Green River country t’other side, an’ he’s
trapped through to the Columbia an’ Vancouver, an’
to Californy, too. Can’t tell mountain-men ’bout the
way to Oregon.”</p>

<p>“Yep; an’ those missionary women crossed
through in Thirty-six, an’ more in Thirty-eight,”
chimed in another. “That broke the trail to the
Oregon country, sure.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me the government must be planning
a line of forts, and the expedition will spy out and report
on that,” remarked Maxwell. “Like as not an army
man will lead it.”</p>

<p>“Oregon country air a fine country,” asserted
somebody. “Think o’ trying it, myself. ’Most went
thar as settler when Joe Meek an’ Doc Newell an’
others took the Columbia Trail after last rendezvous
in Thirty-nine.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trés-belle</span>, ess eet. I hear so from my cousin,
who leeve in la valle Weellamette. He was Hudson
Bay man, trapper; now he farmer,” volunteered Henri
Menard, French-Canadian of St. Louis.</p>

<p>Such was the talk following upon Kit Carson’s
quiet announcement that he would go back this spring
by early caravan to Missouri, and there leave his little
half-Indian Adaline, to give her the schooling which
he had missed. And Lucien Maxwell said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
“guessed” that he would go, too, and visit his parents
and other relatives at Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the company, north led the
trapper trail: from old Taos up through the mountains
of central Colorado, into the South Park, thence on
over by wild passes into the Middle Park. They set
their beaver traps in the side streams of the Grand
River. It seemed best not to go on further, for Indian
trouble was rumored.</p>

<p>This was Ute country, and the friendly dark Utes
with their squaws followed the camps—the squaws
skinning the beaver and asking only the carcass or a
pinch of sugar, the bucks gorging and trading. Deer
meat, elk meat, buffalo meat, and delicious roast
beaver-tail which looked like thick gelatin and tasted
like saltless pig’s-feet, was the camp menu. It was
a very pleasant trapping trip.</p>

<p>About June 1, with eighteen packs of beaver, otter,
and martin pelts—each beaver or otter bale containing
eighty skins—half the company, led by Ike Chamberlain,
rode out for Taos; the others stayed in, to rest
and “make meat” and repair equipment, until opened
the fall fur hunt. In the homeward travelling company
was Oliver, now a seasoned trapper as well as an
accepted “Carson man.”</p>

<p>Old Taos had not changed in the three months.
Only, Kit Carson had gone, as promised, to the States.
He had caught the first of the Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Co.
goods caravans out of Bent’s Fort for Missouri, five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hundred and more miles, to put Adaline where she
would get some education. Lucien Maxwell had gone,
too.</p>

<p>“Wall, Kit won’t stay long,” drawled Ike—his
first remark after hearing the facts. “He’ll find things
are different; the frontier’s grown up with people, an’
he’ll feel lonesome, ’mongst ’em. He’ll be coming
back to Touse, right soon.”</p>

<p>Indeed, according to opinion ’twas time for his
return already; and in mid-afternoon of the day after
their own arrival, Oliver, upon the front porch of the
Carson house, his attention attracted to a bustle and to
the hurrying figure of Ike, thought that Kit might
be in town or at least at Bent’s Fort. Through the
plaza hastened tall Ike; straight-footed, slightly bow-legged,
carrying, as customary, his long rifle.</p>

<p>“Get yore outfit ready for the trail ag’in,” he
bade, quickly, with scarce a pause. “Word from Kit
says to meet him at Fort Laramie, pronto! Leave
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Oliver, astonished, but
knowing better than to delay Ike for foolish questions.</p>

<p>Still, this was most sudden and unexpected. What
was Kit Carson doing up at Fort Laramie, on the
Oregon Trail, when he should have been at Bent’s
Fort, on the Santa Fé Trail? Oliver set out after
information.</p>

<p>The first of the company whom he encountered was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Mariano Medino, the Mexican, squatting and filling a
powder-horn in a doorway.</p>

<p>“Ike has seen you?” queried Mariano.</p>

<p>“Yes. What’s news?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that Keet Carson, he say ‘Come to Laramie,’
an’ we come. That all I know,” answered Mariano,
busily.</p>

<p>“Who brought the word?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dos</span> (two) Injuns. See? Over there,” directed
Mariano, with nod of head.</p>

<p>Oliver looked, and noted a little knot of towns-people—mainly
Mexicans, shoulders and heads
shrouded in serapes or native blankets—standing before
the Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Co. local warehouse and
gazing at the doorway. So across the plaza he trudged.</p>

<p>The knot was scrutinizing, without much comment,
two Indians who leaned, stolid and unaffected
and haughty, against the doorway posts. They were
Indians of lighter coppery complexion than the Kiowas
or the Apaches or the Utes; they were as light as a
Cheyenne, and one had a scraggly moustache of black
hairs. By this, and by the beading of their shirts and
the shape of their moccasins, Oliver (a mountain-man)
knew them to be Indians of a strange tribe. A voice
at his elbow interrupted his examination.</p>

<p>“Those are Delawares, boy.” It was Bill Williams
who spoke—Bill Williams, sometimes called
“Preacher” Williams; not a Carson man, but an odd
old trapper who from his lone trail occasionally appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in Taos. “Eastern Injuns they be, who war
moved by the government into the Injun country ’long
the Missouri frontier. Big hunters an’ fighters, but
don’t often get to the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Are they the express from Kit?”</p>

<p>“They are the runners from Kit. Sent ’em from
the mouth o’ the Kaw, or Kansas Landing ’bove Independence.
Understand they came through, the seven
hundred miles, in ’leven days, which is good travel.”</p>

<p>So it was; and evidently, therefore, the message
from Carson for his men to meet him at Fort Laramie
was urgent. And little time could be spent preparing;
none could be wasted; for as everybody knew, Fort
Laramie was four hundred miles from Bent’s Fort,
and Bent’s Fort was two hundred and fifty miles from
Taos.</p>

<p>Now must the Kit Carson men at Taos fall to,
making ready. Bullets must be moulded, powder-horns
replenished, repairs put upon saddle and shirt and leggins,
new moccasins found or the old ones soled again.
Nobody might tell whither this next trail led, nor how
long ere it would turn home; and few cared, even
though they had just come in from another trail of
three months.</p>

<p>Two men were sent back to the summer camp to
tell the Sol Silver party what had happened; three
were assigned to see the bales of pelts through to
market at St. Louis; and before noon of the following
day the rest, fifteen of them, under Lieutenant Ike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with plenty of horses and mules for saddle and pack,
clattered out of Taos, bound straight for Fort Laramie,
more than six hundred miles away.</p>

<p>Riding northward, on the sixth day the hurrying
squad emerged in sight of Bent’s Fort, above whose
brown, high walls flew the Stars and Stripes: a token
and a challenge, planted here on the farthest border
where the United States met Mexico.</p>

<p>Fording the Arkansas, in this the southeastern part
of present Colorado, the Carson men were in American
territory. Swarthy William Bent, proprietor, who
lived at the fort, and whose wife was a Cheyenne
woman, welcomed them into the broad gateway.</p>

<p>Mr. Bent was enabled to supply a little news.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, there’s a lot of talk this spring of
emigration to the Oregon country,” he said; “reports
from Missouri are, that some one hundred settlers,
including women and children, left, middle of May,
over the trail for Oregon. And a government expedition’s
afoot. Maxwell’s been hired for it. Like as not
you’ll find Kit’s mixed up in some of that business,
too.”</p>

<p>From Bent’s, with its brave flag, its brass cannon
piece upon the wall, and its sturdy garrison, on pushed
the squad.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles more they rode, until, where
green foothills met green plains, under the eye of
Long’s Peak, was stationed, as Oliver well knew, Fort
St. Vrain, brother post to Bent’s. He was wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whether Ike was not intending to swing into the west
and visit this post, when, like the others, he sighted
a horseman approaching at a gallop.</p>

<p>“Injuns!” cried voices in the cavalcade.</p>

<p>“White man, I reckon,” cried others.</p>

<p>“Close up, close up,” ordered Lieutenant Ike,
gruffly. “An’ keep yore eyes peeled for more.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the horseman approached. Nearer he
drew, speeding recklessly, his pony now and then
jumping to avoid a badger hole or prairie-dog hole.
Presently could be descried his long hair and a kerchief
turban streaming in the breeze that he made;
above his head he flourished his rifle—its muzzle puffed
smoke, as signal that he was a friend and was coming
with empty gun.</p>

<p>“White!” grunted several voices, simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Wagh!” uttered another. “Not exactly, boys.
If that airn’t Jim Beckwith, I’m a beaver!”</p>

<p>Jim Beckwith! Oliver knew Jim Beckwith—or
Beckwourth, as he called himself—and had seen him in
Taos. He was a mixed blood, half French and half
negro, and was celebrated because, when early a trapper,
he had been adopted by the Crow Indians and
made a head war-chief.</p>

<p>Arriving, while jogged the squad, he halted his
pony by pulling it to its haunches. A romantic figure
he was, with head bare, Indian fashion, with dark,
handsome, almost Indian features, his sinewy, graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
frame sheathed in gaily fringed and beaded
buckskin.</p>

<p>“How,” he greeted.</p>

<p>“How,” and “Hello, Jim,” greeted the squad.</p>

<p>“From Touse?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Where bound?”</p>

<p>“Up to Fort John.”</p>

<p>“What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Kit sent for us, is all.”</p>

<p>“Wants you on that expedition.”</p>

<p>“What expedition?”</p>

<p>“Government.”</p>

<p>“How’d you know?”</p>

<p>“’Cause part of it’s just passed on up through St.
Vrain. I was there and saw it. Young army fellow
by name of Frémont’s captain, and he said Carson and
rest of the crowd are waiting at Laramie. Maxwell
was along, too, and he said same. Maxwell’s hunter,
Kit’s guide. Kit took one party up by way the North
Platte trail, Frémont and Maxwell came in ’cross country
by South Platte. They’re all to meet at Fort John
or Laramie.”</p>

<p>“Heap doings,” muttered Lieutenant Ike.
“What’s the lodge talk?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oregon trail’s being broken by settlers. First
company’s already passed Laramie. Sioux are bad,
and Gros Vents and Cheyennes have joined ’em, for
war-path up Sweetwater. They’re hot for Crow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
white scalps, and Snake hosses. You fellows are liable
to lose ha’r.”</p>

<p>“Wagh! But what’s this hyar expedition for?”</p>

<p>“To make the trail wider. To tell the government
at Washington where South Pass is, near as I could
find out from Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“But who doesn’t know whar South Pass air!”
exclaimed a chorus.</p>

<p>“Wall,” quoth Lieutenant Ike, “if we’ve all been
thar once we can all go thar ag’in. Kit’s sent for us,
an’ that’s ’nough. Come on, boys.”</p>

<small>FRÉMONT SAYS “ONWARD!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Thar’s Fort John,” directed Oliver’s trail comrade,
William New.</p>

<p>This was the fourth day after the meeting with
Jim Beckwith; the march had been steadily northward,
with snowy mountains distant on the left, and with far
bleak ridges showing ever more clear, in the north.</p>

<p>“Thar’s Fort John,” directed William New.
“Those mountains beyond it are the Black Hills, whar
the Sioux an’ Cheyenne cache themselves.”</p>

<p>“Is that the same as Fort Laramie?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yep. That beaver has two tails, is all. John war
what the Company (and by this Oliver knew that he
meant the great American Fur Company) named it,
an’ that’s what most o’ us old trappers call it; but
‘Laramie’ is the general name ’mongst traders, an’
some trappers too. You see, it’s on Laramie Fork o’
the North Platte, an’ that peak over it is Laramie
Peak, so ‘Laramie’ ’s a natteral word.”</p>

<p>While still riding northward as if to pass by Fort
Laramie on the other side of Laramie Creek, the squad
encountered a plain trail, almost a road, running east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and west; and into this turned at once Lieutenant Ike
and fellow leader. Therefore turned into it all, as
matter of course.</p>

<p>“Hyar’s yore way to Oregon,” announced William
New, for benefit of Oliver. “But thar’s been a heap o’
people passed along since a year ago. Wagh, thar has!
Sign’s fresh, too—people, wagons an’ cattle!”</p>

<p>“An’ thar’s whar we find Kit, I reckon,” spoke
a horseman of the pair in front, nodding before.</p>

<p>“Yes; an’ Injuns, too,” added his comrade.
“’Drather find ’em thar than on ahead.”</p>

<p>“See those lodges?” directed William New, to
Oliver. “Sioux lodges. Few Cheyenne, but mostly
Sioux—Ogalallah.”</p>

<p>Before, beyond the sparse willows and cottonwood
of the creek, stood forth boldly upon a little knoll the
post of Fort Laramie or Fort John. The walls were
of adobe clay, like the walls of Bent’s Fort, but whitewashed,
after Mexican fashion, like many of the houses
in Taos. The fort had towers, at diagonal corners,
square and peaked; and over the principal gateway was
another tower or sentry-box, floating the Stars and
Stripes. Along the tops of the walls stood, like teeth,
a row of palisades. Close beside the walls and below
the post were a collection of conical white tents—evidently
Indian lodges of tanned buffalo hides.</p>

<p>Many figures were strolling about: figures in buckskins
and wool, as well as figures in blankets and robes.</p>

<p>“Thar’s Kit, or else this chile’s eyes don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
fat cow from pore bull!” exclaimed a voice. “An’
thar’s more of ’em camped nigh the river, up above!”</p>

<p>Through the ford, where had crossed the wheels
and hoofs of preceding companies, plashed the squad,
at trot; at gallop mounted the rise which waited; and
with trapper whoop and Indian yelp, and “Whang!”
of sundry rifle, charged for the gate of old Laramie.</p>

<p>The Indians, blanketed to their chins, stoically
stared; from the walls and from the gateway the post
employés witnessed, unperturbed, for they were accustomed
to such arrival; a few other trappers, lounging
about, whooped back, with wave of hand; and a wiry,
sandy, short-legged, broad-shouldered little man, vaulting
upon a horse, dashed out, full speed for the short
distance, hat-brim flaring, hair and fringes streaming,
to meet the incomers.</p>

<p>“Told ’ee it war Kit! Rides like an Injun!”
chuckled the previous speaker.</p>

<p>“Hello, Kit.”</p>

<p>“Hello, boys.” He checked his horse as quickly
as he had started it. “Glad to see ye. Thar’s our
camp, up above.”</p>

<p>“Wall, got yore express, an’ hyar we air,” volunteered
Ike, as all rode on. “What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Government expedition to the South Pass; maybe
further. <a href="#i_fp071">Lieutenant Frémont</a>, army man, is boss;
Maxwell’s hunter, I’m guide. The lieutenant’s got
twenty or so fust-class St. Louis Frenchmen hired for
the trip, but seemed to me I’d feel more comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
if I had some o’ my own crowd. So I sent those two
Delawares to Touse, with the word.”</p>

</div>

<p>As they were about to pass the post another horseman
spurred out, intercepting them. The fact that
this was the “army man,” government “boss” of the
expedition, was impressed upon the cavalcade, and all
eyes turned to scrutinize the rider as he approached.</p>

<p>He rode well and easily—but with somewhat
longer stirrup than the short Indian-hung stirrup
of the Carson men, and sitting rather more erect
than was trapper custom. His costume bore scarce
a trace of army uniform; he wore a short plain
blue blouse, half unbuttoned, over blue flannel shirt
and ordinary jean trousers tucked into high moccasins,
while his head-gear was the broad curly-brimmed
wool hat of the plains and mountains.
He carried no sword. However, athwart his saddle-horn
was lying the inevitable rifle. His figure was
more slender than Kit Carson’s; he was about two
inches taller, and evidently he weighed about the same.
He had a full brown beard, rather compact and wavy,
oval face, white skin now tanned, bold clean-cut nose
jutting like the keel of a boat, and large eyes of
flashing blue. He was not any older than Kit, much
handsomer, altogether a different style of man—more
excitable, more dashing, more like Kit was in an Indian
fight. Yes, here was another type of leader.</p>

<p>“Got your men, I see,” he addressed, reining in,
with a rapid glance along the column.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yep,” drawled Kit. “Hyar they are.”</p>

<p>“And one boy, too,” added the lieutenant, with a
smile at Oliver. “That will make my boys envious.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” remarked Kit, “he’s man an’ on the pay-roll.
’Tisn’t size that counts, always.”</p>

<p>The camp was close ahead. It consisted of about
a dozen small cone-shaped tents of dingy canvas; one
tent, slightly larger than the others, and set apart,
probably was Lieutenant Frémont’s tent. The camp
was thronging with whites in frontier costume, with
Indians and dogs; saddles and packs were stacked in
piles; and out from the creek bank, in a grassy place,
were grazing horses and mules.</p>

<p>From the camp now came racing, like young Indians,
upon their ponies, two boys, as if eager to inspect.
One was younger than Oliver, the other was
older. They, also, were dressed in easy but rough
plains costume, and the younger even wore Cheyenne
moccasins. With brief “Hello” they fell in alongside
the leaders of the column, and accompanied it while
covertly eyeing its make-up. Oliver assumed his best
mountain-man pose, and with equal sly curiosity eyed
them back.</p>

<p>“No, my men will mess by themselves,” was saying
Kit Carson, to Lieutenant Frémont. “O’ course,
thar can be a general camp, but they’ll make their own
way. That’ll avoid any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Lieutenant Frémont.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
“That’s understood, then. I don’t feel authorized
to enlist them.”</p>

<p>To the camp rode on the Carson squad; and at the
lifted hand of Kit, as signal, they were off saddle at
once, to unpack and make another camp—an extension
of first. While Oliver was busy, a voice spoke
to him.</p>

<p>“Your name’s Oliver, Kit says.” It was Lieutenant
Frémont, accosting him with another frank
smile; the two boys, bridle-lines upon arms, were with
him. “I want you young gentlemen to get acquainted.
Oliver, this is Henry Brant, and Randolph Benton, of
St. Louis. They came out by the North Platte trail,
with Kit’s party.”</p>

<p>Oliver flushed, as he shook hands.</p>

<p>“Are you going all the way?” asked Randolph,
eagerly. He was the younger boy, with the Cheyenne
moccasins; his age was about twelve.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We go as far as Kit goes, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“That’s all the way, then. You aren’t afraid of
Indians, are you?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” grunted Oliver, disdainfully.</p>

<p>“We aren’t, either,” declared the older boy, Henry.
He was about nineteen. And he continued, gloomily:
“But we can’t go on. We’ve got to stay here at the
fort, Mr. Frémont says.”</p>

<p>“A Cheyenne boy gave me these moccasins,” informed
Randolph, proudly, sticking out a foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I knew ’em for Cheyenne moccasins, soon
as I saw ’em,” answered Oliver. “But why don’t you
go on?” he invited—liking both boys. “Isn’t the
party going on?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but we’re too inexperienced, Mr. Frémont
thinks. And he doesn’t want to have the responsibility
of us,” explained Henry; continuing, gloomily
as before: “<em>We’d</em> go, if he’d let us; but if the Indians
are bad I suppose we might be in the way, and I’d
rather stay here than get anybody killed looking after
us.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” agreed Randolph, quickly. He was
the livelier of the two. “We almost had a fight, coming
out, anyhow; only they turned into trappers instead
of Indians.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have some fun, at the fort, I guess,” said
Henry, more hopefully. “But you finish up your
work, Oliver. We’ll watch you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” admitted Oliver. “I’ll be done in a
minute.”</p>

<p>He proceeded; his two friends strolled about, keeping
in touch with him.</p>

<p>The Frémont party were composed all of St. Louis
French—the majority seasoned voyageurs and trappers
who as American Fur Company men had before
met the Carson men on the beaver trail. They wore,
some buckskins, but the greater proportion baggy jean
trousers stuffed into high moccasins or boots, and
belted at the waist, flannel shirts adjusted outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
trousers, like blanket-coats and trimmed in red, bright
neckerchiefs, and handkerchief turbans or the wool
hats. A cheery, bustling, dark-faced and dark-eyed
crowd they were, laughing much and singing much
and joking much.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the fort,” proposed Randolph,
at once, when Oliver turned from his last chore.</p>

<p>But the sun was setting behind great Laramie Peak
of the Black Hills, in the west; throughout the combined
camps fires were blazing; and Oliver, keenly
aware of time and place, must reply:</p>

<p>“No; this chile’s wolfish, and pots are on the fire.
Meat, first. Then I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“You eat with us, at our mess,” invited Henry.</p>

<p>“Yes. You can, can’t you?” urged Randolph.
“Buffalo meat, and coffee!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re used to buffalo meat, though,”
hazarded Henry, as they moved on.</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s what we live on, mostly. Don’t
have much coffee. Didn’t bring any, this trip.”</p>

<p>“We lost nearly all of ours—a whole bag full, in
the Kansas River!” chirped Randolph. “Almost as
soon as we’d started. Our rubber boat tipped over
when we were crossing, and Kit Carson and Mr. Maxwell
and everybody had to jump into the river and
rescue things. Some of the men couldn’t swim, either;
but they didn’t care! Kit Carson was sick two days
from his wetting.”</p>

<p>“He’s often been in rivers. Trappers wade to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
their waist in ice-water, setting traps or finding ’em,”
explained Oliver.</p>

<p>“Are you a trapper?”</p>

<p>“I’m learning,” answered Oliver, cautiously. And
he added, with pride: “I’m a Kit Carson man,
though.”</p>

<p>“Do those tacks in your rifle mean scalps?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you take them?”</p>

<p>“No; but Kit Carson did, before he gave the rifle
to me. It was his rifle.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be a Kit Carson man,” declared Henry.</p>

<p>“I’d as soon be a Frémont man,” retorted Randolph,
loyally.</p>

<p>“Well, it takes pluck to follow either of them, I
guess,” admitted Henry. “They’re both brave. You
ought to have seen them riding after buffalo! Kit
Carson’s horse put his foot in a hole and threw him
head over heels and ran away with the buffalo till Mr.
Maxwell caught him; and the lieutenant’s horse chased
so hard and got so excited that it regularly foamed at
the mouth! It’s a trained buffalo horse; name is
Proveau.”</p>

<p>They squatted, trapper fashion, guns against knees,
near a fire upon which a pot of stew bubbled and
steamed attractively. At other fires men were toasting
strips of meat held on sticks.</p>

<p>“You came up from Taos, didn’t you?” asked
Henry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We came clear from St. Louis. That’s about as
far,” piped Randolph. “But I came from Washington,
too. We left Missouri—or Mr. Chouteau’s farm
just this side, the tenth of June and we got here July
thirteenth. We’ve been here a week.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any scrimmages, on the trail?”
queried Oliver.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Henry. “Once we thought we were
going to, but they were just a band of trappers on their
way back to Missouri. We had some fine buffalo hunts,
though. But Lieutenant Frémont almost got into a
big Indian fight. He separated from us, part way;
and he and Mr. Maxwell and a couple of others followed
up the South Branch of the Platte River to the
mountains, while we took the Oregon Trail route,
up the North Branch.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and about three hundred Injuns charged
<em>them</em>, and there’d have been shooting if Mr. Maxwell
hadn’t recognized one of the Injuns and shouted, just
in time: ‘You old fool! Don’t you know me?’ Then
they all shook hands, and went to the Indian village.
They were Arapahoe Indians.”</p>

<p>“What’s this expedition for, anyway?” ventured
Oliver.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” proffered Randolph. “I know
because Lieutenant Frémont married my sister——”</p>

<p>“And his father’s Senator Benton of Missouri,
too,” further explained Henry. “We’re second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
cousins. That’s why we were taken along, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve heard the talk, at our house in Washington,
anyway,” resumed Randolph, interrupted.
“It’s claimed to be an army expedition sent out by
the Secretary of War to examine the country between
the Missouri frontiers and the Rocky Mountains, and
to get the latitude and longitude of the South Pass;
but my father and some other men in Congress hope it
will encourage colonists over into Oregon by describing
the way to get there.”</p>

<p>“Have you been to the South Pass?” asked Henry,
of Oliver.</p>

<p>“No, not yet; but most of our men have. That’s
the big pass on the regular trapper and trader trail,
over the Rockies from this side to the other side.
Everybody knows the South Pass.”</p>

<p>“Wish we were going on,” repeated Henry, wistfully.
“But I guess it’s mighty serious when Kit
Carson makes his will.”</p>

<p>“Did he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You see, our party met a party under Jim
Bridger—you know Jim Bridger, another trapper captain?
(Oliver nodded.) And they all said the country
beyond Laramie isn’t safe, because the Sioux swear
they’ll kill every white man they find there. That
scared our men pretty bad, and Kit Carson got
alarmed, too; and at the fort he made his will, so
that in case he’s killed his little girl he left in St. Louis
at school will be provided for. She’s half Indian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he’ll go on, though, if Frémont goes on,”
asserted Oliver, stoutly.</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s why he made his will. He’s
sensible. It isn’t because he’s afraid.”</p>

<p>When supper was practically over with, and the
men had lighted their pipes for a few minutes preceding
night chores, a figure stepped into the midst of the
lounging groups and lifted his arm, for attention. It
was a slender, quick figure—that of Lieutenant
Frémont.</p>

<p>“Men,” he addressed, clearly, “to-morrow we
break camp, for the outward trail again. We’re well
armed, we know how to take care of ourselves, in a
fight, and Mr. Bissonette, head agent at Fort Platte,
has agreed to go with us, as far as we need him, as
interpreter. He is a friend of the Sioux and Blackfeet,
and can talk with them if we meet them. But as
to these threats by the Indians and these rumors of
danger, you know as well as I do how much they can
be relied upon. You’ve all been in the Indian country
before; you can’t expect to travel in it and not risk a
fight or two. In fact, you knew it before we left
St. Louis. You knew there that the Sioux and Blackfeet
were unsettled, in the Laramie region. I’m going
on, right on, ready for peace or war. I don’t see any
good and sufficient reason why any of you should
break your engagement with the government and me;
but I don’t want anybody in my party who feels afraid
or repents of his bargain. Let him step forward at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
once, and I’ll release him with his discharge and his
pay up to date.”</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence, broken by a laugh
as one man arose, and defiantly stood.</p>

<p>“You wish to stay, do you?” demanded Lieutenant
Frémont.</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>“Are you sick, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Tired, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You did not know that the South Pass was beyond
Fort John, I presume!” pursued the lieutenant,
sarcastically—creating another laugh.</p>

<p>The man maintained sulky silence, hanging his
head.</p>

<p>“Well, my poor fellow, we are very sorry for
you,” continued the officer. “You are welcome to
your pay and discharge, and you can be making garden
at the post so as to have nice vegetables ready for us
when we come back!” Thus having ridiculed him, the
lieutenant asked, generally: “Is there anybody else
who is tired in heart or feet?”</p>

<p>None answered—for which Oliver was glad.</p>

<p>“Humph!” criticised Randolph, as the three boys
trudged off to visit the post. “Wish now they’d take
us instead. But they won’t. I’ve got to stay and wind
the old chronometers every day!”</p>

<p>The next morning Oliver (accompanied by the envious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and disconsolate Henry and Randolph) was paying
another visit to the fort. Lieutenant Frémont,
and Kit Carson and Lucien Maxwell and several of the
French trappers in the Frémont company had entered
the office of Mr. Boudeau, the agent, as if to say
good-by; when through the gate and across the court,
for the office, stalked, with great dignity, half a dozen
Sioux—all chiefs. They were finely built men, several
of them old.</p>

<p>A clerk at the door of the office would wave them
away; but they acted as if they did not see him, and
past him they shouldered, and on in.</p>

<p>“Come on!” whispered Randolph, to his comrades.
“There’s something up. They’re from Fort
Platte, at the Platte River a mile below. I’ve seen
’em there.”</p>

<p>So, the way apparently being open, in after the
Indians sidled the boys.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont was just opening a folded
note, evidently brought by the Indians. They had
seated themselves upon the floor, along the wall, and
were waiting for the result. The white men were
eyeing the missive anxiously, and waiting also.</p>

<p>“This is a note from Mr. Bissonette at Fort
Platte,” announced Lieutenant Frémont; “as follows,”
and he read, in French. Then he continued: “In case
some of us may not have understood it all, I’ll translate.”
And again he read—flushing more as he proceeded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Fort Platte</span>, July 1, 1842.</p>

<p>“Mr. Frémont: The chiefs in council have just
told me to warn you not to set out before the party of
young men which is out shall have returned. Moreover,
they tell me that they are very certain that they (the
young men) will fire upon you at the first meeting.
They ought to be back in seven to eight days. Pardon
me for thus addressing you, but it seems to me that
I should warn you of the danger. Furthermore, the
chiefs who forbid you to set forth before the return of
the warriors are the bearers of this note.</p>

<p class="noic">“I am your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="padr2 smcap">Joseph Bissonette,</span><br />
“by <span class="smcap">L. B. Chartrain</span>.<br /></p>

<p>“The names of some of the chiefs—The Otter
Hat, the Breaker of Arrows, the Black Night, the
Bull’s Tail.”</p>
</div>

<p>As the lieutenant finished, one of the seated chiefs
arose, and dropping his blanket, as signal that he was
about to speak, in guttural tone, with now and then
a gesture, delivered a short harangue. Mr. Boudeau,
the American Fur Company agent in charge of the
post, translated sentence by sentence.</p>

<p>“You have come among us at a bad time,” said the
chief. “Some of our people have been killed, and
our young men who have gone to the mountains are
eager to avenge the blood of their relations, which has
been shed by the whites. Our young men are bad, and
if they meet you, they will believe that you are carrying
goods and ammunition to their enemies, and will
fire upon you. You have told us that this will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
war. We know that our great father has many soldiers
and big guns, and we are anxious to keep our
lives. We love the whites, and are desirous of peace.
Thinking all these things, we have decided to keep you
here until our warriors return. We are glad to see
you among us. Our father is rich and we expected
that you would have brought us presents from him—horses
and guns and blankets. But we are glad to see
you, anyway. We look upon your coming as the light
that goes before the sun; for you will tell our great
father that you have seen us, and how we are naked
and poor and have nothing to eat, and he will send us
all these things.”</p>

<p>The chief sat down, and enveloped himself in his
red blanket. Another chief, doffing his blanket (which
was blue trimmed with red), standing also spoke. He
said, like the first, that they loved the whites very much,
and could not bear to have them injured when they
came as friends, and that it was better for them to
stay safely at the post and not go on. Then the great
father at Washington would be grateful and would
give his red children many blankets and horses and
much food and powder and lead!</p>

<p>Other chiefs spoke, in turn—and all blandly expressed
the hope that in reward for their tender care
of the expedition in forbidding it to proceed, the “great
father” at Washington would liberally reward them!</p>

<p>When the half circle of chiefs had said their say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Lieutenant Frémont replied—Agent Boudeau translating
his sentences into Sioux.</p>

<p>“We thank you for your good words,” replied the
lieutenant, to their up-turned solemn visages. “We
know that you do not wish us to be harmed, and it will
please the great father at Washington to hear about
it. We should like to stay with you a long time, but
the trail is waiting, we have not come to the end of it.
We hope that your young men will not take us as enemies.
That would be a great pity, when we come as
friends. But in case that your young men might not
see plainly, and blood would be shed, and perhaps many
of them killed, we ask that two or three of you go with
us, to signal the young men and tell them that we are
friends. We ask that you go with us, as our guests, to
spread your robes in my lodge and eat at my fire;
and when we return safely I will give presents.”</p>

<p>The chief in the red blanket arose.</p>

<p>“We have heard the speech of the white chief,
and it is good,” he said. “But we are old and poor
and tired, and we cannot travel far on horseback.
We must sit in our lodges and smoke our pipes among
the women, and let our young warriors take the trail.
Besides, we have no power now over the young men,
and it would be bad for us if we tried to interfere on
the war-path.”</p>

<p>He seated himself, and was applauded by a chorus
of grunts from his comrades.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont answered, instantly and energetically—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a glance at Kit Carson as if to read
approval in his sober face.</p>

<p>“You say that you love the whites; why have you
killed so many already this spring? You say you love
the whites, and you are full of words about friendship;
but you are unwilling to undergo the fatigue of a few
days’ ride to save our lives! We do not believe what
you have said; we will listen to you no more. Whatever
a chief among us tells his soldiers to do, is done.
We obey our chiefs. We are soldiers of the great
chief your father. He has told us to come out here,
and see this country and all the Indians, his children.
Why should we not go on and do it? Before we came,
we heard that you had killed his people and wanted
to be his children no longer; but we came anyway,
holding out our hands in peace. Now we find that
the stories we heard are not lies, and that your young
men are on the war-path and you are no more his
friends and children. But we have thrown away our
bodies, and will not turn back. When you told us
that your young men would kill us, you did not know
that our hearts were strong, and you did not count the
rifles that my young men carry in their hands. We
may be few, and you are many, in numbers, and you
may think to kill us; but if you try there will be much
crying of women in your villages, for many of your
young men will stay behind and forget to return with
the others from the mountains. Do you think that
our great chief will let his soldiers die, and will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cover their graves? Before the snows melt again his
warriors will have swept away your villages as the
fires in autumn sweep the prairies. Look around.
See! I have pulled down my white lodges and my
people are ready: when the sun is ten paces higher, we
shall be on the march. If you have anything new
to tell us, you should say it soon. I am done.”</p>

<p>With that the lieutenant turned his back, and
strode out; after him strode Kit Carson and Lucien
Maxwell and all, even the agent, with the three boys
forming the rear. Presently, at decent interval, filed
forth the chiefs, blanket shrouded; they crossed the
court and passed through the gate, for the lodges
without.</p>

<p>“That was a good speech, wasn’t it!” praised Randolph.
“And he means what he says, too.”</p>

<p>“Guess you start right away,” said Henry; for
Lieutenant Frémont had immediately mounted his
horse, at the post gate, and was dashing for the camp,
followed by the other men. So, hastily vaulting into
their own saddles, with a whoop the three boys, abreast,
raced after.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a><br />
<small>INTO THE WILDER WEST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver secretly was pleased to see that Kit Carson,
scouring the plain like a centaur, soon overtook the
lieutenant. No rider could beat Kit. However, neck
and neck they galloped into the camp, and simultaneously
checked their horses short.</p>

<p>“All right. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En avant!</span>” cried Frémont, his voice
ringing keenly. And Kit Carson shouted to his own
squad: “Ketch up, boys!”</p>

<p>The mules and carts were packed and waiting; now
into their saddles clambered the men. Frémont and
Carson and Maxwell and others proceeded to shake
hands with Agent Boudeau; gay salutations of parting
were exchanged.</p>

<p>“We’ll ride a little way with you, but we can’t
go far, I suppose,” vouchsafed Henry, to Oliver.</p>

<p>“We’ll be here when you come back, though. You
can tell us all about it,” proposed Randolph, hopefully.
“You’ll see Independence Rock and Devil’s Gate and
South Pass and Wind River Mountains and everything!”</p>

<p>But they were interrupted, for just as amidst a
jostling and confusion of orders addressed to pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
animals and mule teams the company were forming
upon the march, came galloping from the direction
of the post one of the Sioux chiefs.</p>

<p>“Thar’s Bull’s Tail,” grumbled Lieutenant Ike.
“Wants to say something.”</p>

<p>“The chief says that they are sorry to see you
go in anger,” translated Agent Boudeau to Lieutenant
Frémont. “It makes their hearts sad to think that you
are likely to run into danger. So they have found
a young man who will join you this evening and try
to keep you safe. But he is very poor; he has no
horse, and he expects you to give him one.”</p>

<p>“That is good. Tell him to send the young man.
We will camp about fifteen miles from here, near
where the river Platte issues from the red rocks.”</p>

<p>The chief grunted acknowledgment and loped
back to the post, probably on his way to Fort Platte
below, at the mouth of the Laramie.</p>

<p>Once again the company were set in motion; they
strung out into a long procession, Frémont and Kit
Carson leading; the Frémont party following, and the
Carson party as the second division. The Frémont
party had eight stout two-wheeled covered carts, for
the provisions and tents and scientific instruments.
These carts creaked; the drivers cracked whips above
the two-mule teams; the happy-go-lucky Frenchmen
laughed and sung and chattered; but the men from
Taos rode more gravely.</p>

<p>Now at a turn of the trail, where it entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hills, only a few minutes’ ride from the post, must
Henry and Randolph reluctantly halt, and let the train
continue without them. They waved hand at the men;
and with answering wave from Lieutenant Frémont
and Kit Carson and Oliver, and voyageurs and trappers
all, the cavalcade passed on. Glancing back,
Oliver noted that the hill defile had at once closed,
shutting off view of Fort Laramie. The expedition
was fairly started for the South Pass, 280 miles westward,
at the source of the Sweetwater River. This
was the great pass by which trappers and fur traders
crossed the Rocky Mountains from the east or the
American side to the west side shared by the United
States and Great Britain; it was the pass to Oregon.</p>

<p>The trail, plainly wheel-marked by the party of
the first Oregon emigrants which had travelled through
only three weeks before, traversed a wide, rolling sagy
plateau which occupied much of the space between the
valley of the Laramie Creek, south, and of the North
Platte River, north. About ten miles from the post
a shallow, dry creek-bed was entered.</p>

<p>Down the creek-bed, which now ran with a little
current of clear warm water, continued the procession,
and unexpectedly to Oliver they all emerged at a rapidly
flowing river.</p>

<p>“North Platte,” announced Trapper New, nonchalantly.
“Yep; an’ a heap beaver stream, wagh!”</p>

<p>The leaders had halted; the Frémont party already
were unharnessing and unsaddling; so evidently this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was the camping-place for the night. The upper end
of the valley was closed by cliffs of scarlet, peeping
over a little swell that intervened.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen time when this hyar valley war full o’
buff’ler an’ elk an’ deer,” remarked Trapper New, as
the Carson squad good-naturedly hustled to beat the
larger party in making camp. “But when Injuns air
out, game gets scarce. We’re going to have a lean
trail, I reckon.”</p>

<p>At this moment a ripple of laughter flowed through
the party. Oliver followed the glances, and saw that
the Frémont party were trying to erect a large tent;
rather, a buffalo-hide lodge which they must have
procured from the Indians at Fort Laramie. It was
some twenty feet high, to the peak, and eighteen feet
across, at the base, and was to be stretched like a
cone over a framework of lodge-poles set in a circle
and slanted to meet at a point. Almost the whole
party, including the lieutenant and Kit Carson, were
working at it. But twice it had toppled and fallen,
burying the workers under its folds.</p>

<p>“Now, Kit knows,” complained Ike Chamberlain.
“He’s seen many a lodge put up. But hyar comes
somebody who knows better, I reckon. You watch.
It’s squaw work, anyhow; not man work.”</p>

<p>Into the camp had ridden Agent Bissonette, from
Fort Platte, with two Indians—man and wife. The
woman, grinning broadly, at once trudged to the
struggling group, and by gestures and short exclamations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and by applying deftly her own strength, soon
had the skin tent stretched and stationary.</p>

<p>Flushed and apologetic, Kit Carson strolled to his
squad.</p>

<p>“That’s harder than I thought,” he said. “I’ve
seen a thousand lodges raised an’ struck, but I never
touched one before. Thar always were squaws to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Camp hyar, do we, for the night?” commented
Lieutenant Ike.</p>

<p>“Yes. Frémont wants to ride over an’ inspect the
canyon mouth yon, whar he’s coming down in his rubber
boat, on our way back.”</p>

<p>“He air, air he!” grunted Ike. “Humph! Old
White Head tried that once, didn’t he—’fore his ha’r
turned.”</p>

<p>By “White Head” Oliver knew that Thomas Fitzpatrick,
a noted trapper captain, was meant.</p>

<p>“Wall, he knows that Fitz lost all his furs an’
nigh lost his life, voyaging into those canyons; but he’s
bound to find out for himself, an’ I guess he will.”</p>

<p>The canyon mouth was located at the red cliffs, up
the valley about three miles; and as the sun had not set,
and as there was nothing especial to do, a little bunch
of the men from the two commands rode over. Oliver
saw that here at the red cliffs the Platte came tumbling
out of the mountain country. High upon either hand
rose the scarlet walls, about one hundred yards apart,
their shelves dotted with a few pines, their tops bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a fringe of the same dark-green. The river roared
loudly, as it boiled down. Many rocks stuck up
through the current.</p>

<p>“It’s wuss above,” quoth William New, when they
all emerged, and rode away. “’Tain’t any place for
human being to travel in. Thar’s one place called
Fiery Narrows—wagh!”</p>

<p>“Ah, who fears?” laughed Descoteaux, Frenchman,
of the Frémont party. “Where Monsieur Frémont
go, I go.”</p>

<p>“I, too,” announced Clément Lambert, his
comrade.</p>

<p>Frémont himself, with Basil Lajeunesse, his trusted
adjutant, surveyed the place, the next morning; and
when they rode back it was rumored that the lieutenant
was more determined than ever to launch his boat, on
the return from the South Pass.</p>

<p>As the company continued to advance, the next day,
the country grew drier. Grasshoppers jumped in
clouds from beneath hoof and wheel; so that William
New, with whom Oliver rode, shook his head.</p>

<p>“Signs air bad,” he mumbled. “When hoppers air
many, grass air few.”</p>

<p>No Indians had yet been sighted; but early in the
afternoon a sudden commotion swept the line, as from
scouting service in the advance back galloped four
Frémont men.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aux armes!</span>” they shouted. “To arms! They
come—the savages!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Around whirled their horses Kit Carson and Frémont,
and while the lieutenant and Lucien Maxwell
and Basil Lajeunesse urgently strove with the van,
Kit Carson sped recklessly adown the line to the rear.</p>

<p>“To the river, boys!” he shouted. “We’ll fort
thar, an’ let ’em come! Quick, now!”</p>

<p>How the men jumped to his clear tones! The river
was near, on the right; its hither bank was high and
steep; pack animals and mule teams were forced into
trot and lope; the packs swayed and jolted, the carts
jolted and swayed; loud rose the cries of the drivers.
Just as on the Santa Fé Trail, in the attack by the
Kiowas, now here upon the edge of the river, under
the steep bank the carts were instantly wheeled into
a semi-circle, enclosing the horses and mules. Over
the bank peered the defenders, rifle muzzles forward,
Oliver ready with his tack-studded gift from Kit.</p>

<p>“Bang! Whang!” sounded the reports as several
of the Frémont men fired their guns, to be certain of
their condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Bissonette and the Indian who was to protect
the march from attack by his people had not “forted”
with the column; they had at once ridden on, to meet
the enemy, and to explain. Now here they came, back,
with two new Indians.</p>

<p>“Wagh! Sioux!” grunted the men around Oliver.</p>

<p>Kit Carson, Lieutenant Frémont, Lucien Maxwell
and Basil Lajeunesse stepped out and received the
approaching four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief conference was held only a dozen yards
beyond the bank rampart. The twain Sioux were
painted and half naked (save for the paint on their
chests); they seemed sullen and unresponsive, and
spoke with few words and many sign-gestures. Mr.
Bissonette eked out their tale, and in the fort Trapper
New kept pace for the benefit of Oliver and the others.</p>

<p>“Been on war path, up Sweetwater; looking for
scalps—need scalps to make their dead warriors happy
by a dance, an’ to dry up the tears o’ the women
(wagh!); too many white people in their country;
overtook party o’ whites (emigrants, I reckon) at
Indypendence Rock on Sweetwater; Broken Hand
(Oliver knew that this meant Thomas Fitzpatrick
again) war leading party; half o’ Sioux wanted to
attack, half didn’t; these two war in half that did
want to——”</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em, boys!”</p>

<p>“Feed ’em Galena pills!”</p>

<p>“Lift their ha’r!”</p>

<p>“Tirez! Tirez! (Fire! Shoot!)”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des coups de baguettes pour les scoundrels!</span>
(Shots for the scoundrels!)”</p>

<p>Thus rose the indignant cries, at the announcement.
But Frémont turned and raised his hand commandingly;
and the cries died to a mutter.</p>

<p>“They war in the half that did want to,” continued
Trapper New. “Finally, the war party busted, seeing
they couldn’t agree, an’ have scattered. Most went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
over into Crow country, north, after Crow scalps an’
hosses; rest air travelling back down the Platte. Thar’s
no grass an’ no buff’ler.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont and the others were conducting
the two Sioux around the bank and into the little
fort. Still sullen, the visitors were permitted to gaze
about, and see how angry and well-armed were this
white company. Then they were given a present of
tobacco and told to go.</p>

<p>“Wall,” remarked the quiet voice of Kit Carson,
as, among his men, for a moment he reflectively
watched the two Sioux ride off as if glad to escape,
“I’ve fought Injuns an’ they’ve fought me, in mountains
an’ on plains, for over fifteen year, now—but
sometimes I don’t blame ’em. ’Tain’t natural for ’em
to sit by an’ let their country be occupied by whites—their
country that they’ve owned. An’ that’s what it
means—this settler travel to Oregon: it means white
people on both sides the mountains. Beaver air
thinned, buff’ler air getting scarce, an’ some day thar
won’t be any room for the Injun. An’ they suspect it.
Pore critters!”</p>

<small>OVER THE FAMED SOUTH PASS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The best advice that I can give you is to turn
back at once,” declared Mr. Bissonette, flatly, to Lieutenant
Frémont.</p>

<p>’Twas near noon of the fifth day after the adventure
with the first of the Indians. Other Indians,
mainly Sioux, had been met, in small parties, as the
Frémont company had travelled on up the Platte. This
morning the trail finally had intercepted the road to
Oregon, which here crossed the river, and four miles
beyond more Indians were met. The obliging Mr.
Bissonette had come far enough; by the Oregon Trail
he was going back to Fort Platte at the mouth of the
Laramie Creek, but he lingered to have an interview
with these latest of the Sioux.</p>

<p>“They say that the country ahead is very bad,”
he reported. “Their main village has made a wide
detour from the river to the south, looking for game.
There are no buffalo in this whole region, because on
account of the drought and the grasshoppers there is
no grass. The trail of the village is marked by lodges
thrown away in flight, and by the skeletons of the
horses that the people must eat for food, or that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
starved to death. The best advice that I can give you,
is to turn back at once.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am under instructions to go on to the
South Pass, and on I go,” replied Lieutenant Frémont,
loudly enough for all the men to hear. “But if anybody
wishes to turn back with you, now that there is
the opportunity, he has my permission.”</p>

<p>Ensued a moment of expectancy, as man looked
upon man; no one made the move or said the word.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span> (My goodness!)” exclaimed Basil Lajeunesse,
breaking the spell. “We’ll eat the mules!”</p>

<p>At this they all laughed. Mr. Bissonette shook
hands around, and so did the Indian whom the chiefs
had sent along; and they rode away, down the Oregon
road, for the post—the Indian with his squaw and his
horse-present.</p>

<p>Henceforth Kit Carson was to be the guide, for he
knew the country from the Platte up the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>Ere proceeding, first they must get rid of their
cumbersome baggage and their carts, so as to be able
to travel light and fast. The Kit Carson party already
were travelling light, trapper style; but for plains work
the Frémont party had their carts and the several
tents. However, here, after the discouraging report,
through Mr. Bissonette, from the Sioux, all turned
to and made a cache or hiding place for the discarded
stuff.</p>

<p>The carts were taken apart—hoods and frames and
wheels—and these pieces were stowed out of sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
among thick willows growing near. A hole ten feet
square and six feet deep was dug in a sandy opening
in the midst of the same willows, and lined with brush,
and tarpaulins; and in this were stowed the other
things not absolutely necessary. They were covered
with an old buffalo robe; the sand was thrown in,
the top was levelled and any suspicious “sign”
smoothed away or disfigured; and with pack-mules
laden the company were prepared for the long hard
trail awaiting.</p>

<p>“Wagh!” grunted William New. “Hyar’s whar
we shine. Now for Indypendence Rock an’ the Sweetwater
an’ the Pass over. We got a guide who air up
to trap. That agent purty nigh lost us, but you can’t
lose Kit Carson.”</p>

<p>“How far to the Pass?” queried Oliver.</p>

<p>“Wall, by regular trail it’s ’bout fifty miles to the
Rock, an’ then a hundred to the Pass. But we aren’t
going by regular trail; see? We’re travelling on up
the Platte, an’ it turns southward, for the Bull Pen or
what they call New Park; whilst the regular Oregon
an’ trapper trail cuts the curves, on other side,
lining for the Sweetwater. It’s the Sweetwater that
flows down from the Pass an’ j’ines the Platte below at
head o’ those red canyons we saw.”</p>

<p>The stories by the Indians seemed not true; for
when the next day the march was resumed buffalo
were sighted. Some would have been killed had not
Clément Lambert’s horse, just as Clément was closing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in on the tail of the fleeing herd, plunged headlong into
a sudden ravine; while Clément was climbing out, the
buffalo, tails high, scrambled like goats up a precipice
ridge, and escaped.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the camp that night was supplied
with jerked or dried buffalo meat from a previous hunt,
and found plenty of grass.</p>

<p>Frémont had named the camp, several nights back,
where the buffalo meat had been obtained, Dried Meat
Camp. Yesterday’s camp was of course Cache Camp;
on this all agreed. This afternoon’s camp was pitched
near a mud bank studded with large pebbles worn oval;
therefore William New dubbed it Goose-Egg Camp!</p>

<p>Now according to Lieutenant Frémont’s compass
the Platte was inclining more and more to the south;
and it was rumored among the men that unless they
crossed pretty soon to the Sweetwater, so as to strike
it above its juncture with the Platte, they would be
entangled among precipices. The country was beautifully
red, with brown and pink sandstone and “pudding-stone”
(as the pebbly formation was termed),
and even the soil was red; a curious landscape flowed
through by the greenish river. But twelve miles from
Goose-Egg Camp Kit Carson, riding ahead with Lieutenant
Frémont, halted. So halted the column.</p>

<p>“Injun sign,” announced Ike Chamberlain, for the
way was crossed by a trail of an Indian village which,
here camping, had left lodge-poles and horse skeletons.</p>

<p>But not for “Injun sign” had halted Kit Carson;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he was talking earnestly with the lieutenant and with
Lucien Maxwell and Basil Lajeunesse, and pointing.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to turn off. Knew we would,” predicted
Trapper New. “An’ that army fellow’ll find
out why, if Kit hasn’t told him plain enough an’ he
goes on. Yonder’s whar the Platte comes out the Fiery
Narrows, an’ on above the Fiery Narrows (which are
<em>some</em>, I say!) are nothing but more canyons clear to
mouth o’ Sweetwater. Even a beaver couldn’t get
through, an’ I don’t reckon we can, either. An’ it’d
take a bird to cross.”</p>

<p>Evidently Kit Carson had persuaded, for around
swung the march, to double on its trail as far as a fair
island, divided from the shore by only a shallow current.
Close upon either bank of the river was a red
ridge—one set with the “pudding-stones,” some as
large as a football. Upon this island, grassy and containing
about twenty acres, was established the night’s
camp. To-morrow would the march be directed west
across the angle from the Platte to the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>“Fifteen miles, an’ I’ll be glad to get thar,” asserted
Ike, at the evening fire. “Sweetwater trail is good
trap trail; an’ if we’re locating emigrant route to
Oregon that’s the road.”</p>

<p>The camp was a cheerful spot, this night, being
supplied with mountain mutton; for Lieutenant Frémont
and several of the men had ridden out upon a
little exploring tour, beyond a red ridge, and had returned
with mountain sheep. Now arose a discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as to whether the sheep could leap off high cliffs and
land head-first on their broad-based horns. Ike and
William New, Joseph Descoteaux and others of the
Kentuckians and French in the two parties claimed to
have seen the sheep make such escapes, when pursued—but
not one had seen them land! Mr. Preuss, the
funny, red-faced, bristly-haired German who was the
map-maker and sketcher with the Frémont party and
helped Mr. Frémont in figuring, said that the horns
were for other purpose. However, as Kit Carson and
the lieutenant were inclined to believe that the sheep
could perform these leaps, the theory was generally
adopted.</p>

<p>Goat Island was this camp named, because of the
bag of sheep. At each camp Lieutenant Frémont and
Mr. Preuss fussed with various scientific instruments—thermometer
(which of course everybody knew, because
it told of heat and cold), and barometer (which
somebody said measured weight of air), and a watch-like
thing called a chronometer (companion to which
had been left at the post, for Randolph to keep wound
up), and a sextant (which was claimed to be a sea
instrument). By these instruments were obtained figures,
carefully noted down in a book.</p>

<p>As many of the figures were obtained at night, in
the dark, William New and the majority of the voyageurs
and trappers were much puzzled. Back at the
post the Indians had deemed the lieutenant to be a
great medicine man, who read the sun and the stars;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and his tent was a place of tremendous mystery to
them.</p>

<p>“Latitude so-an’-so, longitude so-an’-so, I hear
said,” grunted Trapper New. “That’s the camping
spot. Now, what air the sense o’ that, unless figgers
air written on the grass an’ rocks so you can read ’em?
When I find a place I don’t look for figgers. It air one
day travel nor’west o’ the second left-hand fork o’
Goose Creek; or it air half-way ’twixt Pilot Peak an’
the head o’ the Little Blackfoot; or some such. But
these hyar figgers! I never saw any figgers, anywhar.”</p>

<p>“What is this camp, Mr. Preuss?” asked Oliver,
politely, of the busy tow-headed German.</p>

<p>“By chronometer and lunar distances and an occultation
of Epsilon Arietis, it appears to be longitude one
hundred and seven degrees, thirteen minutes, and
twenty-nine seconds, east; latitude forty-two degrees,
thirty-three minutes, and twenty-seven seconds, north,”
announced Mr. Preuss. “But we can’t be sure of what
instruments we have left. They are getting badly
shaken up.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Oliver, retiring, knowing no
more than he did before. And he was much inclined
to agree with Trapper New.</p>

<p>When in the morning they plashed away for the
farther bank, they left upon the island a horse, as
garrison. The horse was too worn and lame to travel;
but with its plentiful grass and its abundant water the
island was a perfect horse sanatorium. The poor animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
gave one astonished and glad whinny after them,
and fell to cropping again greedily, as if fearful lest
they might change their minds.</p>

<p>“How far to Independence Rock now?” asked
Oliver, of William New, as Goat Island and the river
sank from view behind the red sandy, pebbly ridge.</p>

<p>“’Bout twenty-three or four mile, I reckon, or what
Injuns call half a sun,” answered Trapper New. “You
must be heap anxious to see that ’ere rock, boy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” admitted Oliver. “I’m going to put
my name on it. Is yours there?”</p>

<p>“Used to be; an’ if somebody or wind an’ weather
hasn’t scratched it out it’s thar yet. But it doesn’t
’mount to much ’longside names that nothing can
scratch out.”</p>

<p>“We ought to camp at the rock, to-night.”</p>

<p>“Can, if we don’t stop shorter,” agreed Trapper
New, dryly.</p>

<p>But they did stop; for as they were descending a
long slope of short brush and flowers, and a glimmer
of a stream, at the bottom, had risen the glad cry:
“Sweetwater!” another cry interrupted. “Buffalo!
Buff’ler!” At the mouth of a shallow valley, across,
had appeared dark masses that looked like moving
gooseberry bushes.</p>

<p>Down dashed Lucien Maxwell, the official hunter
of the expedition; down dashed Kit Carson, and Clément
Lambert, and Ike and William New, and Oliver
himself; and as soon as they could down dashed others:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
so that by the time camp was located beside the Sweetwater
and fires had been made, <a href="#i_fp104">the first buffalo had
fallen to the crack of Kit Carson’s rifle</a>. Oliver killed
a fat cow and a huge bull; his Kit Carson rifle shot
strong and true. Every hunter was successful, so that
this night there was much meat in camp, and the
company did not mind sleeping under sage-bushes, in
a rain. Only the big lodge had been brought along,
and here was no tree to serve as lodge-pole.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_104">THE FIRST BUFFALO HAD FALLEN TO THE CRACK OF KIT CARSON’S
RIFLE</a></div>
</div>

<p>The next morning they moved up the Sweetwater
to Independence Rock.</p>

<p>“Thar she is—the Sign-board o’ the Sweetwater
Trail to South Pass,” directed Ike, as the Carson squad
came in sight of a gray mass up-swelling like an enormous
whaleback above the sea of sage; a single pine,
like a scrap of a fin, upon its very spine.</p>

<p>“She’s independent, all right,” observed William
New. “She stands out alone. But I reckon she war
named ’cause some o’ Ashley’s beaver-hunters, who
broke this trail, after the Injuns, ten or fifteen year
ago celebrated Fourth o’ July hyar, or Indypendence
Day, as it air called down east.”</p>

<p>Independence Rock was a huge bare weather-beaten,
rounded mass of gray granite, forty yards high
and 650 yards long, rising right out of the plain, on
the north of the Sweetwater. As seemed to Oliver,
curiously examining the surface, about everybody who
had passed had carved or scratched his name or initials.
Here were names of trappers, traders and missionaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
already thickly placed as high as arm could reach from
horseback. To read the collection was a fascinating
pastime. Oliver found Kit Carson’s name, and Jim
Bridger’s, and Jim Beckwourth’s, and William New’s,
and Ike’s, and Sol Silver’s, and General Ashley the
famous Missouri fur-trader’s; etc. And there were
many Indian signs; and there were names, freshly
carved, of the emigrants who had passed by only two
or three weeks before. And a large “<em>Independence</em>.”</p>

<p>This afternoon part of the company (whose names
were already upon the rock) went buffalo hunting;
but Oliver and the others attacked the rock.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered the red-headed Irishman Tom
Tobin, appearing from the other side of the rock,
carrying a ladder made from cross-sticks tied with hide
thongs to a pair of lodge-poles.</p>

<p>“Sioux ladder,” pronounced Mariano the Mexican.
“Bueno!”</p>

<p>Climbing by aid of this, they placed their names
much higher than any names yet.</p>

<p>Early the next day the second of the Sweetwater
Trail wonders was reached. This was Devil’s Gate,
five miles above Independence Rock. It was another
canyon, but very narrow, about 300 yards long, and
almost 150 deep; and through it, among boulders and
jagged blocks, roared the Sweetwater. The trail to
the South Pass made a circuit back from this Devil’s
Gate, so as to dodge the rough ridge; but Lieutenant
Frémont and the scientific Mr. Preuss, and Oliver and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
many others who never had seen into Devil’s Gate, or
who wanted to see into it again, rode over to the rim
and peered down.</p>

<p>The trail was growing rougher. The Sweetwater
rippled in and out of little parks or pockets amidst
the low hills of its valley; a mountain range bordered
the valley on either hand, and to the south
the slopes were ablaze with fires set by the Indians to
drive the game (said William New) back to the open
country. The fire seemed to make rains gather; and
to-night’s camp was another wet, uncomfortable camp,
but nobody complained. However, the rain, sweeping
down from the high country, certainly was cold!</p>

<p>“See thar?” invited Trapper New, to Oliver, the
next morning, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>They were topping a little rise, still near the faithful
guiding Sweetwater; and far before, against the
horizon, in a vista opened to the march, a line of dark
mountains.</p>

<p>“Those air the Wind River mountains, to north
o’ the South Pass. Pass cuts one end o’ them, I reckon.
They’re heap medicine mountains; Injuns say they’re
ha’nted by evil spirits. The Crows won’t go in ’em.”</p>

<p>“How far?” asked Oliver, gazing hard.</p>

<p>“Seventy miles, ’bout.”</p>

<p>The Sweetwater was slowly dwindling, as they approached
its sources. They picked up an Indian horse
whose hoofs were sore; and an Indian dog, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
glad of the scraps that the men tossed to him. But he
wasn’t friendly, and Oliver named him “Wolf.”</p>

<p>Rain, and rain, and rain! That was now the
weather program, every day; and when, five days
beyond Devil’s Gate, at last the morning broke with
sunshine, suddenly near at hand, right before, rose
grandly with complete robe of dazzling white the Wind
River mountain-chain. So high and aloof were they,
that upon their flanks the rain had been snow.</p>

<p>And now the South Pass was near indeed, for
the Sweetwater was dividing into several streams,
spreading like the veins of a leaf, to drain the little
side valleys.</p>

<p>“What do yore figgers say as to our height up?”
queried Ike, carelessly, of Mr. Preuss.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, yet, my friend,” responded Mr.
Preuss, nervously.</p>

<p>“Wall,” remarked Ike, “I can tell you without figgers
that we’re climbing. Cactuses air going; moss air
beginning; an’ that’s a sartin sign, in the hills.”</p>

<p>Oliver kept his eyes sharp set for the celebrated
pass. He had before crossed the top of the Rocky
Mountains; but here was a pass the most famous of
all—said to be the only single pass by which the
traveller changed at once from the east side to the west
side of the mountains. So he watched keenly.</p>

<p>The morning was rainy, again; Kit Carson and
Lieutenant Frémont led the march away from the
wheel-marked road which had been followed much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the time, and took a saddle and pack trail that swung
out, one side. They all rode along leisurely and without
trouble, winding about upon a series of billowy
slopes, with the Wind River Mountains gradually
unfolding gap and crest, on the right. After a ride
of five or six miles Kit Carson and Lieutenant Frémont
halted, and engaged in a discussion, while now and then
pointing and examining. The cavalcade gradually
gathered about them.</p>

<p>“I’ve been hyar, on an’ off, during a dozen years,”
was saying Kit Carson, mildly. “An’ I nor any other
man can ever be exactly sure. But ’cording to my
notion an’ my recollection, this ought to be it.”</p>

<p>“It seems so to me, too,” concurred the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“But where’s the pass?” queried Oliver, of
William New.</p>

<p>Trapper New chuckled.</p>

<p>“Whar? Look under yore hoss, boy. You’re on
it!”</p>

<p>“South Pass?” stammered Oliver, astounded.</p>

<p>“Right. Kit says the top—didn’t ye hear him?
Behind air the United States, before air Oregon. All
that ’ere country, west to the mouth o’ the Columbia
at the Pacific Ocean; that air Oregon. And wagh!
what a beaver country! Down below us, northwest,
air the Valley o’ the Green River, big trappers’ rendezvous
place.”</p>

<p>This was the pass—the great South Pass? They
had halted upon an open swale between twain low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
rounded, smooth hills; behind them, the route which
they had traversed, stretched a billowy sandy slope
which was the ascent, but which Oliver had not recognized
as such.</p>

<p>“About the grade of Capitol Hill, from the Avenue,
at Washington,” commented Lieutenant Frémont.
“How is the other side—the same?”</p>

<p>“About the same,” nodded Kit.</p>

<p>“How runs the road to the Columbia—the remaining
part of this Oregon Trail?”</p>

<p>“At the foot of the pass thar’s the Little Sandy
an’ the Big Sandy Rivers, an’ all flat desert clear to the
Crossing o’ the Green River. Then it gets rougher
from the Green west to the Bear an’ on northwest up
the Bear to the Sody Springs. Then it air on westward
and northward from the B’ar to Fort Hall at the
Snake; west up along the Snake—or what some call the
Lewis Ford o’ the Columbia—a two weeks’ march
across the Plains o’ the Snake an’ a bad country beyond
to Fort Boisé toward the mouth o’ the Snake; then it’s
across the Blue Mountains, to the Columbia; an’
from thar it air ’bout two hundred miles to Vancouver,
they say. As for myself, I’ve never been much west,
on that trail, o’ Goose Creek between Hall and Boisé.”</p>

<p>Gazing into the west, where hazy lay Oregon, Frémont’s
blue eyes kindled and flashed.</p>

<p>“What a country!” he said. “And there waits
the trail. It’s a hard trail, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Right hard. These wagons ahead of us may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
get through to Fort Hall, but beyond Hall it’s hoss,
mule an’ moccasins, nigh a thousand miles.”</p>

<p>“It’s a trail I’d like to try,” mused Frémont.
“And it’s a country worth a bigger try. The United
States has better claim to it than England has. England
has her hunters there—we’ll have our farmers
there; and the man who tills the soil is the man who
wins the land. He produces, and stays; the trapper
only consumes, and moves on.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” responded Kit Carson,
slowly. “We trappers open the way—but that’s all.
I’ve often thought that I’d go to farming, an’ I believe
I will. Some o’ the mountain-men air at work already,
in the Columbia country.”</p>

<p>“Well,” quoth the lieutenant, “we’ll have to see
more of that country; this isn’t the end of the trail,
yet, you know. But the South Pass is about the limit
of my orders. However—en avant! We can camp
at the west foot, on the Pacific side. I want to cross.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br />
<small>PLANTING THE HIGHEST FLAG</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was the third day after the halt upon crossing
of the South Pass; now in camp by a lake at the head
of the New Fork of the Green River, northwest from
the South Pass, the lieutenant had decided to climb the
Wind River mountain-chain, to the northeast, and
measure the highest peak.</p>

<p>Here in the grove of beech-trees amidst which
the camp was located the lieutenant fortified by raising
a breastwork of logs; in charge of this camp and corral
he and Kit Carson left about half the company, under
Baptiste Bernier of the Frémont party; and with the
other half, provisioned by dried meat, maccaroni and
coffee for two days, they set out.</p>

<p>“Wall, boy,” said Kit, in telling off his own party,
to the expectant Oliver, “what do you think? Can
you make a climb like that, into the snow? You’ll
freeze yore moccasins.”</p>

<p>The Carson tanned, sandy face was solemn, but the
keen gray eyes were twinkling; for he read Oliver
through and through. He knew how hard Oliver
<em>wanted</em>.</p>

<p>“I think I could do it,” answered Oliver, hopefully.
“I’m not afraid to try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better come along then,” bade Kit; and proceeded
with his duties.</p>

<p>Oliver went.</p>

<p>One snowy peak of the heavily-wooded, white-crested,
sharp-toothed ridge to the northward seemed
to stand up above all others. This was accepted by the
camp below as being the highest peak of the Wind
River Mountains. Some of the men thought it to be
one mile, some two miles, some three miles high; and
all declared it to be higher than the great James’ or
Pike’s Peak which was the landmark northwest of
Bent’s Fort.</p>

<p>The South Pass had been crossed during August 8;
now early in the morning of August 12 the little party
left Camp Bernier (as it was christened, in honor of
Baptiste its commander), and upon the best of the
hardy mules, with pack animal for the coffeepot and
the meat kettle and a few tin cups and the provisions,
each member carrying at his saddle a blanket for bedding,
headed forth for the great feat.</p>

<p>The first day’s travel conducted amidst a richly
verdured country of trees and grass and flowers, secret
valleys, rushing streams and gem-like lakes—a constant
surprise to Kit Carson and all, who never had
penetrated here before. In late afternoon were passed
wonderful lakes which poured one into another by
cataracts; and through a silent level forest, grassed
like a city lawn, the explorers, riding on, camped in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
dark, rock-and-pine surrounded little gulch—“the
heart,” as William New expressed, “o’ nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Never white nor Injun war in this region before,”
he asserted, with wag of his shaggy head.
“This chile ain’t afraid; but if these hyar mountains
air ha’nted an’ the spirits air up to trap, they got a
chance to get us, sure!”</p>

<p>However, Oliver saw Kit Carson wink at the lieutenant
and Lucien Maxwell, as the speech reached
them, and it was evident that these three leaders did
not believe the Indian tales. Consequently he himself
decided that the reports of “evil spirits” awaiting were
all bosh.</p>

<p>Kit Carson pointed through the little gulch.</p>

<p>“Thar’s our peak,” he said.</p>

<p>In the gulch defile dusk had gathered; but outside
still lingered the twilight, and beyond the end of the
gulch lifted, massy in the near distance, a snow summit.</p>

<p>There was space for only a few stars at a time
to peer down into the narrow gulch; but the camp fires
lighted redly the jumbled rocks and the crowded
circle of pines like blanketed Indians of heroic size.
Guarded by fires, and stars, and courage, and by One
who was nearer than the fires, farther than the stars,
and mightier than courage, here through the chill
black night of the deepest wilds safely slept the camp.</p>

<p>In the morning start was made early. The ride
onward, up a long valley which flowed with springs
and bloomed with many flowers, promised success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
And when they reached the head of the valley, they
found themselves at a fair little lake, set about with
asters, in a green lawn bordered by rocks and pines.</p>

<p>At the edge the park fell away into a wide cross-draw
rippled by ridges; and across it, apparently not
more than a mile, rose again the Wind River Range
surmounted by the high peak.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and Kit Carson determined that
now the mules and the baggage might be left and that
the draw should be crossed and the climb beyond be
made afoot. Accordingly, here in this beautiful little
basin was stationed a “mule camp”; here were left the
provisions and blankets and coats, with two or three
men in charge. Afoot the others pushed on, in their
flannel shirt-sleeves—for so near seemed the snowy
range that they felt certain of climbing it and returning
before dark! Lieutenant Frémont carried tucked
inside his shirt an American flag, of special design
showing amidst the stars an eagle clutching peace-pipe
and arrows. Such a token the Indians could understand.
This flag the lieutenant wished to plant on the
loftiest spire of the West.</p>

<p>This proved a very deceptive valley. Those ridges
which looked upon from above had appeared to be
ripples, when inspected from below were gigantic
breakers, 500 feet high, frequently separated by chasms.
Therefore the pace was up, and down, and back and
around, and each task achieved brought but another
as hard or harder. Rocks fell, waters seen and unseen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
roared, the difficulties increased, and almost might the
wayfarer believe, like Trapper William New, that the
Wind River Mountains were held under the rule of evil
spirits.</p>

<p>By four o’clock the line of bristling snow-seamed
crests looked as far ahead as ever. Now torn and
scarred and hungry and exhausted, the party came
together upon the sandy beach of another little lake,
amidst the innumerable ridges. Here upon a broad
flat rock above the lake they camped for the night.</p>

<p>Just beyond the lake and camp all trees ceased, and
around about were snow patches. The sun sank, behind
the dark ridges; an icy breeze sprang up, soughing
through the few pines, mingling its song with the
weird chant of a waterfall emptying into the lake
below.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was suddenly stricken with a violent
attack of headache and stomach-sickness. They decided
that this was due to climbing up and down among
the rocks, and to the lack of food and warmth. The
breeze blew away the heat of the fires, the moon arose
and seemed to make things colder, the granite rock was
hard and chill, they had nothing to eat and no coverings;
and altogether it was an uncomfortable camp.</p>

<p>Nobody complained, of course. They were men,
and explorers. Kit Carson said that he had been in
worse places, and afterwards had been in better places,
and that he expected to be in better places again! This
was a cheering thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver curled in the lee of a fire, so that a little
of the heat might blow across him, and occasionally
he dozed. Whenever he awakened, he saw the grim,
whitish line of pinnacles, cold and still in the moonlight,
as if watching and waiting for their next efforts.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, “not being delayed by any
breakfast,” as remarked Lieutenant Frémont (who
was better), they set out again.</p>

<p>Now the enchanter guarding the magic pinnacles
doubled his spells against them. Steeper were the
ridges, sharper were the precipices, more loudly roared
the waters, ice and snow were strewn underfoot. Mr.
Preuss slipped and slid head over heels down an ice-field
into the bristling rocks at the bottom. But he
was only bruised. Clément Lambert and Joseph Descoteaux
were taken ill and must lie down in their tracks.
Lieutenant Frémont also was taken ill, again, in head
and stomach; and halting sent his barometer on to Mr.
Preuss the plucky German, who was ahead. Mr.
Preuss must proceed to the high peak and see what
the barometer said when there. But Mr. Preuss found
himself cut off from the peak by a precipice or canyon.
Kit Carson, trying to reach Mr. Preuss and help him,
discovered a trail to the main divide, and climbing
a knob or butte saw the high peak, which they had been
calling the “Snow Peak,” still a thousand feet above
him!</p>

<p>So back he came, and they all went into council.
Lieutenant Frémont seemed to be growing worse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Clément Lambert and Joseph Descoteaux were very
weak; but nobody was ready to quit. Instead, Basil
Lajeunesse with a party of four was despatched back
to the Mule Camp, to bring up mules and provisions
and blankets. How the mules would get through none
might say; but they would, for mules always did.
Wherever a man could go, a mule could go.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better go along back, too, boy?”
asked Kit Carson, of Oliver; and Oliver shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I’m all right; I’d rather stay,” he said, trying
not to let his teeth chatter.</p>

<p>With Lieutenant Frémont very ill and scarcely able
to stagger, they returned to the camp on the rock above
the lake, and waited here.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont, pale and giddy, lay with his
arm over his eyes, to shut out the light; the others sat
about—Clément Lambert and Joseph Descoteaux languid,
their heads drooping. Silence reigned—and
sharper and colder stood forth the line of pinnacles,
as more swiftly sank the sun. Presently Lieutenant
Frémont stirred, sat up, and spoke.</p>

<p>“I think that we’ve done about all that we can, in
this direction,” he said. “What do you think, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled Kit Carson, quietly, “we can
climb it if we keep trying along enough. I’ve been in
wuss places before.”</p>

<p>“The survey itself is finished—as much as the
War Department would require, and I doubt if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
extra risk to all concerned in the party is authorized,”
continued Lieutenant Frémont. “I think that first
thing in the morning you’d better take the most of the
men and go on down to the Mule Camp; and after
we make a few more observations the rest of us will
follow. Basil probably won’t bring up enough stuff to
last the whole party of us long.”</p>

<p>“Thar he comes,” announced William New.</p>

<p>Sure enough! The clatter and scraping of hoofs
among rocks could be heard, plainly, from below. And
presently a small cavalcade struggling over log and
boulder appeared, rounding the end of the lake. A
cheer welled—“crack! crack!” rifle and pistol exchanged
salutes—and soon the rescue squad panted
into the camp at the flat granite rock.</p>

<p>They were Basil and four new men in place of
the four whom Basil had worn out on the trip down;
and their saddle animals and several led mules, bearing
blankets and provisions. Hurrah! Now with the hot
coffee and the dried meat served hot or cold it seemed
that the fires, as if fed also, burned brighter, that the
rock was softer, that the breeze was gentler, and that
even the grim row of pinnacles, o’er-watching, vented
a smile or two. Rolled in the army blankets everybody
slept.</p>

<p>For his part, so soundly slept Oliver that when he
opened his eyes it was to sunshine and breakfast preparations.
Rather scandalized at his laziness (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was not laziness at all) he struggled to throw off his
blanket and to sit up.</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss and Auguste Janisse (who was one of
the Frémont Frenchmen) were busy attending to fire
and coffee; otherwise the camp seemed deserted.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning,” greeted Mr. Preuss, his tow
hair upright as usual, his German features red. “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du
hast sehr wohl geschlept;</span> what? Well, they have
gone and left you.”</p>

<p>“Who?” stammered Oliver, blinking about.</p>

<p>“Kit and your party; Maxwell and the others,
too.”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“No. We stay.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui;</span> we stay. Maybe we try again,” added
Auguste.</p>

<p>At the moment Lieutenant Frémont strode around
a rock; he and Basil Lajeunesse and Joseph Descoteaux
and Clément Lambert had been down to look after the
mules.</p>

<p>“Hello, my boy,” spoke the lieutenant, with cheery
smile. “Kit and your crowd have gone; they went at
day-break, as arranged last night, for the mule camp;
but we thought we’d let you sleep.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” stammered Oliver, striving to
collect his memories. “I was to go, too. I didn’t
mean to sleep over. Can’t I catch them?”</p>

<p>“You can stay with us, if you like. We’ll follow,
during the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment Clément Lambert winked and
nodded so hard at Oliver, that Oliver decided
promptly:</p>

<p>“I’ll stay, sir.”</p>

<p>For evidently something especial was brewing, besides
coffee!</p>

<p>At breakfast the secret came out.</p>

<p>“We’ll make one more try, boys,” spoke Lieutenant
Frémont. “The day’s fine, we’re in good shape
with food and a night’s rest, and Basil and I’ve noted
a narrow draw off the left that looks like a trail to the
top of the divide. We’ve got all day before us, and
can take things easy.”</p>

<p>“Good!” approved Mr. Preuss; and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien!</span>
Good!” echoed the others, nodding.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect to do this, when I let Kit and the
rest go back,” said the lieutenant. “But we ought not
to miss this chance. The boy here must represent the
Taos crowd.”</p>

<p>And Oliver determined that he would if he could.</p>

<p>Enough food for one more meal was saved, and
covered over with rocks so that birds would not eat it.
Then upon the mules they set forth, to climb that
highest peak. They felt fresh, the mules seemed to
feel fresh; and through the long narrow draw, almost
a little canyon, they made steady way. This was the
defile which the lieutenant and Basil Lajeunesse had
discovered. Sure enough, it led up and out to the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
divide itself. And here they were, at last, mules and
all!</p>

<p>The mountain chain now rose above them like a
huge granite wall, well-nigh perpendicular, and breaking,
two or three thousand feet above their heads, into
a line of saw-tooth peaks. They were enabled to ride
along until under the Snow Peak itself; upon a grassy
bench above a trio of mystic green lakes, they turned
loose the faithful mules, and proceeded to climb afoot.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” ordered the lieutenant, as they
panted in the thin air.</p>

<p>Each picking what he considered the easiest trail,
they gradually strung out. The lieutenant had left
his rifle down near the mules, and wore his pistols;
but some of the men had no pistols and some refused
to lay aside their rifles anyway, for it was against
mountain-man rules ever to move from camp without
rifle in hand. Oliver carried his Kit Carson rifle;
and as he toiled to keep up with Basil and Mr. Preuss,
just in front of him, glancing aside he saw that the
lieutenant, off by himself, was halting, to change his
thick moccasins for a pair of thin ones. Then the
lieutenant continued, lightly and rapidly, up a steep
bare stretch which he had found.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En avant, mes braves,</span>” he panted, cheerily—which
was French for “Forward, my brave fellows.”</p>

<p>He sprang ahead for another of the many irregular
ridges or wrinkles; what an energetic, tireless man
he was, thought Oliver; he was almost the equal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Kit Carson—and he was only an army officer and was
not a trapper. Up to the top of the next rock ridge
scrambled the lieutenant; and abruptly his voice
sounded, thin but commanding:</p>

<p>“Look out! Wait where you are! I think this is
it!”</p>

<p>He was bracing himself cautiously, as if balanced;
and he peered around, examining the horizon. More
cautiously he stepped back, and down a few paces.</p>

<p>“Now, one at a time,” he called. “No more. And
be careful.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss climbed, stood, and in turn backed
down; Basil Lajeunesse did the same; and did the same
all, Oliver last. Oliver found himself upon a comb
of gray granite, only about three feet wide, wind-swept
of snow, sloping keenly and breaking, in another step,
to an icy precipice—as the eaves of a house break
beyond the gutter-pipes. Five hundred feet below, like
the roof of a porch, for instance, lay a great snow-field,
which sloped off to another precipice; and after this
a snow-field which might be called the ground below
the porch-eaves spread abroad to a ridge (which might
be a buried fence) a mile away.</p>

<p>“Come down,” ordered the lieutenant of Oliver;
and as cautiously as anybody Oliver backed off.</p>

<p>The lieutenant mounted again, and the instruments
were passed up to him. He took observations; then
tying his flag to a ramrod he planted it in a crevice of
the rock cap. Backing off, he drew his pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ready!” he called; there was quick cocking of
pistols and rifles; “fire!”</p>

<p>“Crack-crack! Spat! Crack!” Flat were the
reports, cut short without echo; but the Stars and
Stripes here unfurled had been saluted.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont and Mr. Preuss were busily
figuring out what the barometer and the thermometer
records would tell them.</p>

<p>“Thirteen thousand, five hundred and seventy
feet,” announced Lieutenant Frémont. “Probably the
highest peak of the Rockies—and certainly the highest
flag in the world,” and he removed his hat.</p>

<p>They removed theirs, for a moment.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span> And the highest bee in the world!”
ejaculated Auguste Janisse, pointing to his knee.</p>

<p>A bumble-bee had lighted upon it!</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed the lieutenant. “Who’d
think to find a bee up here in the ice—more than two
miles high! Well, my little chap, you deserve to live
if you can, but this is the best I can do for you, in the
way of flowers;” and gently plucking the numbed
insect from Auguste’s knee he laid him among the dried
botanical specimens between the leaves of a field book.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br />
<small>THE VOYAGING OF THE PLATTE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Several days had gone by since, on this noon of
August 15, in this year 1842, the Frémont little squad,
toiling where never before had stepped human foot—foot
of Indian nor foot of even hardy trapper—at last
stood upon what they believed to be the highest point
of the Rocky Mountains. To-day we know that Frémont
Peak, at the western border of Wyoming, is not
the highest point of the Rocky Mountains; it is outranked
by many another peak; but mere figures cannot
always measure human endeavor, and in boldly assailing
and overcoming this the highest, most kingly peak
within their knowledge, there to plant their flag, Lieutenant
John C. Frémont and companions show as fine
quality of spirit as though the crest had been a thousand
feet further. They did their best, to the limit of
opportunity.</p>

<p>To-day is August 23. The great South Pass from
which still onward stretched into “Oregon” the
wagon-wheel track of the first American emigrants
has been re-crossed; and again at Independence Rock,
Frémont has paused to inscribe amidst the thickly
written names a large cross—token of westward pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Christianity and civilization. This cross he filled
with softened India-rubber, to preserve the trace.
From the Rock he continued east on down the Sweetwater
to its mouth. Here at its juncture with the
Platte he is about to launch, on the morrow, his rubber
boat.</p>

<p>This boat (which smelled very disagreeable—“wuss’n
the tar springs at head o’ Yellowstone,” complained
William New) was twenty feet long and five
feet wide, when unfolded, and had air-tight compartments
to be blown up or inflated so that it should not
sink if capsized. It already had capsized, once, on the
Kansas River, at the start of the expedition from
Missouri.</p>

<p>Now the lieutenant was determined to canoe down
the Platte, through the canyons, to see what the river
looked like where it was hidden from the trail. Kit
Carson shook his head over the plan.</p>

<p>“You’d better not,” he said. “It’s too dangerous.
Thar air nothing but red canyons, one after another,
cl’ar till the Platte gets out the mountains, at our fust
camp above Laramie. Canyons air full o’ falls an’
rapids, an’ some o’ those rocks sticking up will punch
a hole in that rubber contraption, sure. Fitzpatrick
tried the trip, by boat, once, an’ lost all his pelts an’
’most lost his life.”</p>

<p>“Chut!” smiled the lieutenant. “My orders are
to survey the Platte, and that seems the only way to
do it. With this boat and good men to handle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
paddle I’ll start at day-break and meet you at Goat
Island for breakfast!”</p>

<p>So was it arranged that the main portion of the
company should cut across by the land trail, as before
taken, for Goat Island where they had left the Platte
for the Sweetwater on their way out; and that the
lieutenant and his crew should go on down by water.</p>

<p>The Taos party, including Kit Carson also, had
been disappointed over not climbing the peak, and
Oliver had felt elated; but none, not even Oliver, was
disappointed over being omitted from the boat crew.
For his crew Lieutenant Frémont selected Mr. Preuss
the German; Clément Lambert, Basil Lajeunesse,
Honoré Ayot, Leonard Benoit, Joseph Descoteaux,
who were accustomed to paddling.</p>

<p>Camp was broken at dawn. The rubber boat,
stretched and inflated, had been packed with ten or
twelve days’ provisions, principally dried meat, and
with the precious scientific instruments, and with
enough bedding.</p>

<p>“Thar’s a thirty-foot fall down a ways! Hear her
roaring?” shouted Trapper New, as the boat-crew
launched forth. “Watch out for her!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded and gayly waved his hand.
His men paddled hard, the Platte was broad and
smooth for several miles, and with its load the rubber
canoe glided rapidly down.</p>

<p>The land party watched for only a minute. They
must cut across for Goat Island, so as to meet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
voyagers there, at breakfast—although the lieutenant
had said that if he reached it first he would leave a
note before passing on. However, he did not reach it
first!</p>

<p>It was only about twelve miles across from the
mouth of the Sweetwater to the Platte at Goat Island.
Here on Goat Island was found the horse that had been
left there to recover; she now was sleek and seemed
strong upon her feet, and very glad to see the other
horses and the mules.</p>

<p>By breakfast time the lieutenant had not appeared;
nor did he and his squad appear by ten o’clock. Higher
climbed the sun, marching from east to west through
the great blue dome, and Kit Carson and all began to
grow uneasy. Close watch was kept of the river, for
any tokens of a wreck; but nothing unusual drifted
down upon the swollen tide which ran turgid with the
rains and melted snows.</p>

<p>“Something’s gone wrong with that rubber contraption,”
declared Kit. “I knew it would. I told
’em so.” And he fidgeted here and there. “We’d
better ride up the river, as far as we can, on both sides,
an’ find ’em.”</p>

<p>So while a portion of the party remained to guard
the camp, the others divided into two squads to scout
either side of the Platte. Kit led a little squad up
on the right, Oliver was told off to ride with Ike
Chamberlain’s squad, on the left.</p>

<p>The country along the left side of the river waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
more and more difficult, with occasional cross canyons
and frequent ridges of red and of white sand-stone interrupting.
Some of these ridges and buttes were fantastic,
looking like castles and spires and lighthouses.
Oliver enjoyed the ride, but the obstructions only
vexed Ike and the others. At a point whence a good
view was given up the river for a quarter of a mile
they dismounted, and seated themselves, and lighted
their pipes.</p>

<p>“Hyar’s far enough,” declared Ike. “We can
catch ’em if they come floating past. They haven’t any
business down in thar anyhow.”</p>

<p>Oliver lingered a minute; but this sitting here was
rather stupid.</p>

<p>“I’m going on,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Wall,” grunted Ike. “Twon’t do you any good.
Yonder’s the Fiery Narrows. If they air wrecked in
thar you can’t get at ’em, an’ if they ain’t wrecked in
thar they’ll come out.”</p>

<p>Oliver rode along. He wanted to see those Fiery
Narrows for himself.</p>

<p>The broken country forced him out and back from
the river; and when he came in again he judged, from
the roaring sound, that he must be at the Fiery Narrows.
The river here swirled wildly through between
reddish walls a hundred and more yards high. Slipping
from the saddle and cautiously approaching the
best and firmest spot, holding his horse by the lines
Oliver craned his neck to peep in. The sight almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
made him dizzy. Glancing about from side to side he
thought that he espied a trail. Down he clambered,
rifle in hand.</p>

<p>The depths of the Fiery Narrows were a terrifying
place for a landsman. The Platte, coffee-color and
heavy with sediment, fairly boiled through, without
beginning and without end; its current dashed in foam
against up-sticking rocks, and spun from projecting
shoulders; surely no boat of any kind could live in such
an angered turmoil!</p>

<p>Suddenly Oliver witnessed an astonishing spectacle.
As his eyes shifted from the opposite shore (which
rose not so sheer, although still steep and high) to
scan up-stream, they encountered a dark object speeding
down upon the current. It was the Frémont boat—the
rubber boat! And hurrah—the crew were
aboard; all were safe!</p>

<p>One man was kneeling in the bows, with paddle, to
turn the boat quickly; the others were ranged, paddles
in hands, along the sides; now and then they dug hard
with their blades, to keep the craft bows on with the
current or to dodge a rock; but they came gallantly,
and as they came, they appeared to be singing. How
fast they sped! Maybe they would make it.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont was plainly visible; so was
Mr. Preuss. Basil Lajeunesse was the one in the
bows. He was wet; they all were wet, as if they had
capsized, already. Of course something had happened
to them, for they were late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, in an instant, something did happen. Just
ahead of the boat was a little fall, where the current
plunged over a ledge. It seemed to Oliver that the
boat could leap this; he wondered if the crew saw it,
before them; but he could do nothing, by voice or gesture,
to warn them. He held his breath, watching. Out
into the fall sprang the boat; but it did not clear—it
toppled head-first, and spilling crew and baggage right
and left it reappeared bottom-up!</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp130">As it came whirling down, helpless and inert,
heads broke up around it.</a> Lieutenant Frémont bobbed
to the surface; he rose to his shoulders, as he swam,
battling the current and looking for his men. Twice
he was shunted from a sharp rock; and now he gave
up and struck out lustily for the shore. He landed,
and landed below him Mr. Preuss.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<a id="i_fp130">
  <img src="images/i_fp130.jpg" width="379" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_130">AS THE BOAT CAME WHIRLING DOWN, HELPLESS AND INERT,
HEADS BROKE UP AROUND IT</a></div>
</div>

<p>Now the boat had lodged against the Oliver side of
the canyon, where a rock shoulder out-jutted. Basil
Lajeunesse had clambered upon the upturned bottom,
which looked like a huge turtle shell, and reaching he
grabbed somebody by the hair. It was Joseph Descoteaux.
Oliver heard what they said; they were only a
few yards above him, and the words drifted along the
canyon wall. He had picked up a smattering of French
at Taos, where Kit Carson and others spoke it as well
as Spanish.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lâche pas,</span>” gasped Joseph; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lâche pas, cher
frère!</span>” (“Loose not, loose not, dear brother!”)</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crains pas,</span>” panted Basil, sturdily. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je m’en</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vais mourir avant que de te lâcher!</span>” (“Fear not.
I’ll die before I’ll let you go!”)</p>

<p>That was a brave answer.</p>

<p>Basil hauled Joseph upon the boat-bottom. In one
hand Joseph clutched a double-barrel gun, which was
Lieutenant Frémont’s. And now, dripping, out upon
a narrow strip of sand bordering the current, below,
and where Oliver stood, crawled Clément Lambert,
Leonard Benoit and Honoré Ayot, so that all the crew
were accounted for.</p>

<p>However, there was no time for exchange of sympathy.
Down with a rush came the wreckage—blankets
and boxes and record-books and pieces of
clothing, and even the iron instruments; for so heavy
was the water and so rapid was the current that the
instruments had not yet sunk.</p>

<p>“Quick!” bade Clément. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vite! Arrêtez-les!</span>”</p>

<p>And he began to wade and grasp. From across the
stream the lieutenant and Mr. Preuss, encouraging
by gestures, also were rescuing the property. With a
plunge Oliver seized a long black box which he knew
contained the telescope, but the current almost overthrew
him, and it whisked the box from his fingers.</p>

<p>Only a few of the things could be stopped; at last
the lieutenant, with a gesture in sign-language, said
that he and Mr. Preuss would continue on down-river
along their edge, which was the left bank of the river,
and that the others should continue on down by their
edge which was the right bank. But Basil Lajeunesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the boat having been turned over again, boldly embarked,
with a paddle, and took to the current.</p>

<p>“Hello,” remarked Joseph Descoteaux to Oliver,
now that there was time for greeting. “You saw
us, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n’est-ce-pas? Ma foi,</span> but I was drowned if Basil
had not held tight.”</p>

<p>“That Basil, he is a water-rat; he is a beaver,”
pronounced Honoré Ayot. “We nearly were wrecked
above, too, when the boat stuck fast and the water
flowed right over us. After that we would have
driven the boat by a rope paid out from on shore;
but Basil was jerked in like a fish, and all you could
see was his head like head of swimming beaver, as he
was carried on down. Before he had caught up with
the boat he had swum a half a mile.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what he said when the lieutenant
hauled him aboard. ‘Ugh!’ said Basil. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je crois
bien que j’ai nagé un demi mile</span>—I verily believe that
I have swum a half a mile!’”</p>

<p>They all continued along the water’s edge, in the
canyon; clambering and wading and looking for
articles from the wreck. A few record books were
picked out; that was about the extent of the salvage.
Across, the lieutenant and Mr. Preuss were likewise
seeking.</p>

<p>“I’ll go back and climb out and make for camp,
to tell ’em you’re coming,” proposed Oliver.</p>

<p>So he did. He found in camp his own squad, and
Kit Carson’s squad, arrived ahead of him, they having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
seen nothing from the rim. Fires were built up, and
more meat was cut, in readiness. Late in the afternoon
Basil and Clément, Ayot and Descoteaux toiled in,
afoot, over the pudding-stone ridge and down to the
island. They had abandoned the boat at a narrow
place where it would not pass through, and Benoit had
left to join the lieutenant.</p>

<p>At sunset the lieutenant and Mr. Preuss and Benoit
appeared, descending from the same ridge; they had
waded the river to cut across some bends. And right
glad were all the voyagers to have the hot fires and
the roasting meat awaiting them.</p>

<p>“Told you you couldn’t get through with that thar
boat,” reminded Kit Carson, mildly, to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Well,” responded Lieutenant Frémont, “we were
under instruction to survey the Platte, and I felt that
we should obey them to the fullest scope. We did our
best.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant had only one moccasin, and his feet
were prickly with cactus spines; but the next morning
he seemed to be well recovered. Basil was sent up to
the foot of the Narrows, to bring down the few other
articles that had been rescued and left there. They
did not amount to much. All the instruments but the
sextant were lost. However, the saving of the record
books was good fortune, and the instruments had performed
their principal work.</p>

<p>Now Fort Laramie was near. The next day Cache
Camp was reached, and the carts and other property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
which had been left there in hiding a month almost to
a day were found undisturbed. With mules hitched
to the carts again the expedition might victoriously
trundle on for Fort Laramie. The Black Hills loomed
nearer, on either hand; and with the Stars and Stripes
in the advance the cavalcade on August 31 emerged
from that little defile which afforded the first, as it had
afforded the last, glimpse of the post.</p>

<p>From the parapet of the post burst a puff of white
smoke; and following, echoed a dull “Boom!” The
post must have seen the flag. “Boom! Boom!”
saluted the single brass cannon, as on marched the
cavalcade; presently smaller puffs of smoke welled out,
from beside the post walls; that was rifles. Two
figures came galloping. They were Henry and
Randolph.</p>

<p>“You said forty days—you said that you’d be back
in forty days,” they proclaimed. “This is the forty-second.
We’ve been watching for two days. The
Indians have been watching, too, and the minute you
left the mouth of the valley they saw you and recognized
the flag. Hear the cannon?”</p>

<p>“Crack! Crack! Whang!” answered the expedition’s
rifles, to the welcome by the fort; and the garrison
rushed out, with glad tongue and friendly hand.</p>

<small>FRÉMONT CALLS AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Thus into that post of Fort Laramie which they
outward-bound had left on July 21, now on August 31
they inward-bound rode again, triumphant. Nothing
in particular had occurred here; ’twas they who
brought the main news—of a South Pass surveyed and
a highest peak christened and a Platte River boldly
penetrated.</p>

<p>“And all we did was to wind an old chronometer!”
complained Randolph, disgustedly. “But I suppose
we had to.”</p>

<p>The day after the arrival at the fort the Taos men,
including Kit Carson and Lucien Maxwell, started for
home, southward; the Frémont party were to continue
on, eastward, down the Platte, by the Oregon Trail,
for Missouri; but at the parting it was understood that
the next spring, after the lieutenant had made his
report to the government, he was coming out with
another expedition to explore along the Oregon Trail
west of the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River,
and that he would want Kit Carson again.</p>

<p>Down to old Taos rode the Carson trappers, home
bent; and home they were, ere the middle of September.
Taos was glad to see them and to hear their tales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Sol Silver and his party were still out, of course, to
remain until the fall fur hunt. There was the fall fur
hunt for all, and the fall buffalo hunt to supply Bent’s
Fort with winter meat. Then might the Carson men
settle to a winter at Taos.</p>

<p>It proved to be a cold and snowy winter; but right
in the midst of it, or about Christmas time, arrived
excitement: three strangers, ragged and frost-bitten
and weary, reduced almost to eating their buckskin
clothing. A squad of Taos trappers brought them in
from camp in the mountains.</p>

<p>One of the visitors was a half-breed guide from the
trading post of Fort Uncompahgre, across near to the
Grand River. Another was a tall, lean, roughly
bearded man, with hair peculiarly marked in white and
brown, deeply-set dark-blue eyes and large mouth.
This was Dr. Marcus Whitman. The third was also a
bearded man, broad-shouldered, light-blue eyed, with
high forehead and calm mien. This was Mr. A. L.
Lovejoy.</p>

<p>Dr. Whitman was a missionary doctor; he had been
at the Green River trapper rendezvous in 1835, on his
way west; and in 1836 he had led a party of missionaries
including his bride and another woman (first
white women to cross the Rockies, they) from the Missouri
to the mission settlements of Oregon. Mr. Lovejoy
had been among those American colonists who last
spring, under Sub-Indian Agent Dr. White, had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the wagon-wheel tracks seen by the Frémont company,
up the Platte and the Sweetwater, over the South Pass,
and on.</p>

<p>Now upon desperate mid-winter journey across
continent from coast to coast was hurrying Dr. Whitman,
with his brave companions, to appeal for more
Americans in Oregon where the British also claimed
the country. The little party had cut south, from
Fort Uintah of present northeastern Utah, down
through the mountains of present central Colorado,
aiming for Santa Fé and for Taos, to evade the plains
Indians and the deep snows. But the latter they had
not evaded, and they nearly had perished miserably.
Once they had swum, horses and all, an ice-encrusted
river. And they had been obliged to kill their faithful
dog and eat him.</p>

<p>Dr. Whitman and Mr. Lovejoy had left the mission
headquarters on the Columbia October 3; now it was
the middle of December; after a couple of weeks’ stay
at Taos, to gain strength, they pushed on, for Bent’s
Fort and the Santa Fé trail to Missouri.</p>

<p>The next event at Taos was the marriage of Kit
Carson, on February of this new year 1843, to the
Señorita Josefa Jaramillo, only sixteen, much younger
than he. An exceedingly handsome girl was the
Señorita Josefa, with clear creamy skin and great
black eyes and dazzling teeth. The occasion was celebrated
by a series of feasts and dances which lasted
through several days and nights. At the close everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was worn out, so popular were Kit and his girlish
bride.</p>

<p>In March Sol Silver took a party of trappers upon
the regulation beaver hunt. The other Carson men
remained in Taos, waiting.</p>

<p>“Wall, boy,” remarked Kit, to Oliver, when the
members of the Silver party were being told off,
“which would you rather do—go up among the Blackfeet,
with Sol, or out among the Chinooks, with
Frémont?”</p>

<p>“Frémont, and you,” promptly answered Oliver;
and Kit Carson laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re liable to find it the hard trail o’ the two,”
he commented, dryly.</p>

<p>The spring waxed and waned, and came no word
from Lieutenant Frémont, save the word that his report
had been made to Congress, had spoken well of
the Indian Country and of the trail through it, and
that there was much talk of a big emigration, over the
trail, this year, for Oregon.</p>

<p>Finally, about the middle of June, arrived a message
from Kansas Landing, on the Missouri frontier,
that the second exploring expedition of Lieutenant
John Charles Frémont had started, and that the rendezvous
was to be Fort St. Vrain. “White Head,” or
Thomas Fitzpatrick the famous mountain-man, was
the guide, and Lucien Maxwell was accompanying as
far as St. Vrain, on his way to Taos.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the Carson party to mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and ride for Bent’s, thence to proceed on northward
for St. Vrain, 200 miles. But at Bent’s was it learned
that Lucien Maxwell had hastened south, from St.
Vrain, to obtain mules in Taos, for the lieutenant;
and that the lieutenant and a party were following,
along the foothills, to meet the mules.</p>

<p>Now, at this time Texas was striving to be free
from all claims of Mexico, and armed Texans had
been invading New Mexico and threatening Santa Fé
and Santa Fé caravans. This had caused the Mexican
government to forbid intercourse back and forth across
the border between New Mexico and foreigners; and
the chance that Lieutenant Frémont might secure mules
from Taos was slim. At Bent’s Kit Carson himself
turned off, up the Arkansas, to meet the lieutenant and
to warn him of conditions.</p>

<p>He met him at the little settlement of the Pueblo,
about seventy miles from the post. The town is to-day
Pueblo, Colorado. Lieutenant Frémont immediately
sent Kit back to Bent’s, with a request that the fort
supply some mules, if possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Carson men, under Ike Chamberlain,
rode on to St. Vrain.</p>

<p>Fort St. Vrain was situated opposite where the
St. Vrain creek empties into the South Platte River,
not far from the present Colorado town of Greeley.
It was built of adobe clay bricks, and was commanded
by Mr. Marcelin St. Vrain, younger brother of the
Ceran St. Vrain who formed one in the partnership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Co., of the Santa Fé Trail. A slim,
boyish man was Marcelin St. Vrain, with black hair,
black eyes and black whiskers. His wife was a Sioux
girl.</p>

<p>The fort was out on the plains, a short distance
from the foothills. Here awaiting the return of the
lieutenant from his side trip up the South Platte and
down to the Arkansas was Thomas Fitzpatrick with a
detachment of twenty-five of the Frémont men.</p>

<p>A ruddy-faced, rather heavy-set man was Thomas
Fitzpatrick, with thick hair turned snow white and
with his left hand crippled. A severe adventure, in the
summer of 1832, with Blackfeet Indians who had
chased him and forced him to hide in a cave for three
days, had whitened his hair; and the bursting of his
rifle had crippled his hand. The Indians called him
not only “White Head” but also “Bad Hand” and
“Broken Hand.”</p>

<p>He and Ike and the other Taos trappers greeted
each other tumultuously, for all knew and respected
Thomas Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick had brought the wagons and the heavy
baggage. He was waiting and resting the animals.
Lieutenant Frémont had taken one light wagon, and a
cannon—a brass twelve-pounder; for this second expedition
was armed with a field-piece, to be used if the
Indians grew too bold.</p>

<p>About this cannon centred much of the post gossip.
Some of the rumors said that the cannon was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
be used to conquer Oregon from the British; some said
that it was to be used to seize California from the Mexicans;
nobody knew exactly what the plans were, save
that the trail was to lead across the mountains, and
west by the Snake to the Columbia, surveying the overland
route until it connected with the survey north and
south along the Pacific Coast in California and Oregon,
made by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the Navy in
1841.</p>

<p>To operate the cannon piece the lieutenant had
engaged at St. Louis a regular cannoneer, by name of
Zindel—Louis Zindel, who had been a non-commissioned
officer of artillery in the Prussian army. Besides,
in the company was a young negro man, named
Jacob Dodson, not a slave, but free born, although in
service to the family of Senator Benton, the lieutenant’s
father-in-law; two greenhorns, Mr. Theodore Talbot,
government draughtsman of Washington, and Mr.
Frederick Dwight, of Springfield, Massachusetts, who
was making a tour to the Sandwich Islands by way of
Vancouver; Mr. William Gilpin, also for Vancouver;
and two Delaware Indians, old man and son. Then,
here at St. Vrain, in the Fitzpatrick company, were
two comrades of the 1842 expedition: Alexis Ayot and
Baptiste Bernier, whom Oliver was glad to see. Five
other members of the first expedition—Mr. Preuss, the
bristly-headed German scientist, Basil Lajeunesse the
fearless voyageur, Louis Ménard (a cousin of Maxwell),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
François Badeau and Raphael Proue—were
south with the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Consequently, although Oliver felt somewhat disappointed
that Henry Brandt and Randolph Benton
were not to be along, he foresaw, by the preparations
and by the make-up of the company, that it was going
to be a tremendous trip.</p>

<p>A few days later, in rode Kit Carson with ten fine
mules from Bent’s Fort; and on the morning of July 23
in rode the lieutenant and party, including Jacob Dodson
the negro youth, and Sergeant Zindel the artillerist,
and Mr. Preuss, and Basil Lajeunesse. Lucien
Maxwell was not with them. He had not come back
from his trip after mules at Taos.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had left word at the Pueblo that he
would wait at St. Vrain until the morning of the
twenty-sixth. The morning of the twenty-sixth
dawned, and no Maxwell had appeared. Evidently
he was not coming. So the lieutenant ordered “Catch
up!” and the company bustled for the start. At this
moment arose a new complication. Lieutenant Frémont
had decided that he ought to find a short cut
from St. Vrain’s Fort across the mountains to strike
the Oregon Trail somewhere near the South Pass,
instead of travelling up to Fort Laramie and then
turning west for the Pass. Nobody at St. Vrain’s
could tell him of any trail except a danger-trail used
mainly by hostile Indians. Such a trail did traverse
northwest, to the Sweetwater; but it was being given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
over to the Plains Indians when they raided the Utes
and the Snakes, and to the Crows when they raided
the Plains Indians, and only recently several trappers
had been killed on it.</p>

<p>Thereupon, hearing the plans, the two Delawares
announced that the mountains looked cold to them, the
trail was beset with their enemies, they were far from
their own people, and they were going home.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Lieutenant Frémont. “Let
them go. We want only men. But we must find another
hunter or two, to take their places.”</p>

<p>“Godey’ll sign up,” advised Fitzpatrick. “You get
him and you’ll have somebody almost as good as Kit.”</p>

<p>Alexander Godey was a young French trapper and
trader at the post. Everyone seemed to like him; and
although he put considerable time upon his long, wavy
black hair, brushing it and dressing it with Indian care,
none ventured to twit him about it. He was not a man
to be twitted.</p>

<p>“How about him, Kit?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“A fine fellow,” assured Kit, generously. “I don’t
know a better. Take him.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Godey of the silky locks was engaged.</p>

<p>The Snake widow of a French trapper who had
been shot in a Fourth of July celebration at the fort
asked the lieutenant if she might not journey with the
expedition as far as the Bear River, beyond the Green,
so that she could join her own people; and she was
accepted, and given a small tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The expedition made an imposing sight. The Frémont
party numbered some forty men, as against the
twenty-five of the previous year. The Carson party
were fifteen. The Frémont men were armed with Hall
flint-lock breech-loading rifles, which had been adopted
by the army and were thought to be a fine gun; but the
Carson men were better armed, with percussion-cap
rifles, and with Colt revolving pistols. Besides the
brass twelve-pounder, there was a baggage train of
twelve two-wheeled carts and a light spring-wagon for
the instruments, and six pack-horses loaded with the
Snake squaw’s household goods.</p>

<p>This was altogether too large an outfit with which
to thread the danger-trail of the short-cut. Therefore
Fitzpatrick the Bad Hand was directed to take the baggage
train and about twenty-five of the men, and
proceed by the customary trail from St. Vrain’s Fort
up to Fort Laramie; thence by the Oregon Trail west
over the South Pass and on to the British Hudson Bay
Company post of Fort Hall. The lieutenant and Kit
Carson would take the rest of the company through by
the short cut, and meet him at Fort Hall.</p>

<p>For his party the lieutenant chose Kit, and Charles
Preuss the bristly-headed German, and Jacob Dodson
the young colored man, and Louis Zindel the Prussian
artillerist, Basil Lajeunesse and his brother François
Lajeunesse, Baptiste Bernier, Louis Ménard, Raphael
Proue, Baptiste Derosier, François Badeau, Auguste
Vasquez a Spanish Creole, and Henry Lee. The Snake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
woman with her six packs (atop of one her two black-eyed,
pretty little children) accompanied; and there
were the Carson men.</p>

<p>The course from St. Vrain’s fort was northwesterly,
across a rolling country. On the third day
William New announced, to Oliver his partner:</p>

<p>“Thar she air.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cache-à-la-Poudre,</span> or Hide-the-Powder
Creek. We follow her up, I reckon, into the mountains.
Know why she has that name?”</p>

<p>“Trapper name,” hazarded Oliver.</p>

<p>“Right. Thar war some Frenchmen hyar’bouts
on the creek, five or ten year ago. Injuns got after
’em, an’ they cached their powder under-ground, so’s
to save it. Don’t know whether they ever found it
ag’in or not, but they always referred to the creek as
their ‘Hide-the-Powder’ creek, an’ the name stuck.”</p>

<p>The cavalcade turned up the creek, in the rain, and
entered among rugged, lofty mountains, their wild
ravines and steep slopes thickly covered with brush
and flowers. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cache-à-la-Poudre</span> was crooked, and
must be crossed and recrossed; the gun-carriage, overseen
by the anxious Sergeant Zindel, and the spring
wagon with its precious instruments, were hauled
through each time.</p>

<p>Thus was traversed first by explorers and map-makers
the Overland Stage Route from Denver to
Salt Lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>From the head of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cache-à-la-Poudre</span> they all
passed over a ridge to the Laramie River side of the
divide here; loomed high, bare and snowy on the west,
the mighty Medicine Bow Mountains, which they must
go around, and now they encountered a wide Indian
trail and sign of Indian travel upon it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a><br />
<small>IN HOSTILE TERRITORY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>So far the only traces of travel preceding had
been those of Indian travel. This afternoon who
should appear upon the trail but a large red ox! Had
he been an elephant he would have created no keener
interest, and both the Frémont party and the Carson
party collected about him.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span>” exclaimed François Badeau. “Mebbe
we back in Missouri, hey?”</p>

<p>“That’s shuah a big fine ox,” commented Jacob
Dodson. “Guess some o’ those emigrants we saw at
Kansas Landing are ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Not very close, Jacob,” answered the lieutenant.
“The Oregon Trail is a hundred and more miles
north, yet.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me this ox must have cut loose from his
party at the Green, an’ he’s making a short cut back
through the hills, for Missouri,” decided Kit Carson.</p>

<p>With their red ox in charge the expedition proceeded.
It seemed to Oliver rather mean to turn the
brave animal about and make him retrace his trail;
but in the morning he could not be found, and the
lieutenant ordered the men not to look for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fact is,” declared the lieutenant, to Kit, “I’m
glad he got away. He’s won his life, so far as we’re
concerned. I’d rather starve a while than kill the old
fellow and eat him.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled Kit, “we’ll see if we can’t do better
than pore beef.”</p>

<p>Whereupon, as if in reward, that evening he
brought into camp a buffalo cow whose fat was two
inches thick: the finest buffalo, asserted every man,
that he ever had tasted.</p>

<p>To date the march had been not hard, and not unpleasant.
The gun-carriage and the spring-wagon had
come through without mishap. However, this next
evening occurred the first accident, when, the company
having crossed the North Platte River to the north of
the Bull Pen or New Park, they were caught by the
gathering dusk in a deep ravine, where grew sage six
feet high. Both lamps of the spring wagon were
knocked off, a thermometer was broken, and finally,
at ten o’clock, camp was pitched in the dark. Supper
was at midnight. Some of the men, who were out
hunting buffalo, did not get in at all.</p>

<p>When they did come, in the morning, they brought
much meat, and the lieutenant and Kit agreed that it
would be wise to dry this meat, for a store against
future need. There would be few buffalo, on the
Pacific side of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Camp was moved down the ravine, to a cottonwood
grove in a grassy little bottom-land upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
bank of the Platte. In this open place between the
river and the bluffs, pole frame-works were erected,
on which to hang the strips of buffalo meat, above
fires, to dry.</p>

<p>Louis Ménard was horse-guard. Fortunately, he
had a quick eye, had Louis—and on a sudden the busy
camp, with all hands at work “making meat,” was
startled by his loud shout, the “Whang!” of his Hall’s
carbine, and the tumultuous thud of hoofs as he raced
his herd for the grove.</p>

<p>“Injuns! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des sauvages!</span>” he yelled, pointing over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>True enough. Down from the bluffs at the upper
end of the bottom-land were galloping a score of
half-naked Indians, while into the sky-line of the summit
behind them were pouring many more.</p>

<p>“To the grove! To the grove!” cried French and
Americans, Frémont and Carson men.</p>

<p>“The cannon!” ordered Sergeant Zindel, gutturally.
“Qvick! Dis vay!”</p>

<p>All raced, afoot, for the grove, where Louis was
driving his herd.</p>

<p>“R-r-round mit id!” gasped Sergeant Zindel.</p>

<p>The majority of the voyageurs and trappers instantly
ranged themselves flat upon the ground, amidst
the brush, or crouched behind trees, carbines and rifles
at a ready. But the sergeant, and Jacob Dodson the
colored man, and two others, remained out with the
gun, before the grove. They were the cannoneers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Lieutenant Frémont calmly walked forth, and stood by.</p>

<p>On dashed the red warriors—their robes and
feathers flying, war bonnet and decorated braids
streaming in the air. Brandishing bow and lance and
gun and shield, with shrill yelps they now were charging
across the level.</p>

<p>“Cheyenne an’ ’Rapahoe,” muttered William New.
“Wagh! I wonder if they know what they’re doing?”</p>

<p>Oliver anxiously watched the cannoneers. How
rapidly they worked. Sergeant Zindel evidently understood
his business. With jerky stiffness he bustled
hither, thither—but already the piece had been swung
about, to open down the bottom-land, a load in red
flannel bag had been rammed home, and Jacob Dodson
was thrusting after it a case of canister.</p>

<p>“R-r-ready!” ordered Sergeant Zindel, squinting
along the breech, while Jacob turned the elevating
screw. He sprang up, blowing a match or slow-fire
fuse. “Back mit you! Back-vaaerts, all!” And
Jacob and the two other helpers recoiled, out of range
of the imminent explosion.</p>

<p>“The blame fools!” muttered William New, at
the Indians. “They’ll be blown to smithereens.
Wagh! they will! It’ll rain scalps.”</p>

<p>The racing reds now were scarce two hundred
yards away, charging madly, hammering their ponies’
flanks with moccasined heel, urging to top speed.</p>

<p>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuer!</span>” shouted stanch Sergeant Zindel, suddenly
advancing his slow-match to touch-hole—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Oliver’s eyes leaped to see the enemy shrivel and scatter.
But——</p>

<p>“Wait!” commanded Lieutenant Frémont, springing
to arrest the sergeant’s hand. And——</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Kit Carson, running out, his hand
high.</p>

<p>For just at the instant the Indians, as if they had
noted whom they were charging, in mid-pace had
hauled their ponies short, and ploughing up the sod
had stopped in a jumbled mass of wildly tossing riders.</p>

<p>“Just in time, by thunder,” exclaimed William
New. “Another minute, an’ thar’d ’a been more meat
than buff’ler meat scattered about on this hyar bottom.
Wagh!”</p>

<p>A single rider had come forward from the serried
front of mounted warriors; Kit Carson strode right on,
to meet him, and hold parley. The whites in the grove
might breathe easier.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tonnerre!</span>” was reciting Louis Ménard. “As
I sat my horse, out there, I happened to glance at the
bluff and saw an Injun stick his head up over. That
was the good fortune; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n’est-ce-pas?</span>”</p>

<p>The sergeant, and his cannoneers, and the lieutenant,
remained in the open beside the piece, awaiting
the result of the parley. The sergeant occasionally
blew upon his slow-match; and once he and Jacob
hitched the gun around a few inches, for still better
aim.</p>

<p>Presently Kit Carson turned back, and with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
came two chiefs. The other Indians followed, slowly,
riding at ease; and many, dismounting here and there,
squatted or strolled about, gradually forming a semi-circle
of seated forms.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” announced Ike Chamberlain, standing
at ease. “Kit’s made the peace sign. Wall, they
jest saved their scalps, I can tell ’em.”</p>

<p>“We’d ’a bo’hd a thousand holes right through
’em; we shuahly would,” declaimed Jacob Dodson.</p>

<p>“These air a war party o’ Cheyennes an’ ’Rapahoes,”
explained Kit Carson to the lieutenant. “They
say they tuk us for Crow or Ute enemies—but being as
they’re on their way home after a licking up north an’
consequently air feeling ugly, I reckon they tuk us for
what they could get; an’ that warn’t much.”</p>

<p>“It would have been more if they hadn’t stopped
when they did,” answered the lieutenant. “I suppose
now they want presents. We’ll have to give them a
little. Can’t spare much—and they don’t deserve even
that.”</p>

<p>The chiefs grunted and shook hands with the lieutenant;
they cast curious glances at the brass cannon,
and exchanged a guttural comment.</p>

<p>“They think that’s heap gun,” interpreted William
New. “White man’s medicine strong, they say.”</p>

<p>The uninvited guests, squatting in expectant half-circle,
like hungry but dignified mastiffs, willingly
passed the pipe of peace around, and as willingly
accepted tobacco and scarlet cloth and knives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ve been up ag’in the Snakes, over on the
Green River,” repeated William New, to Oliver, after
having chatted with one or two. “They surprised a
village near Jim Bridger’s fort, while most o’ the men
folks were off on an antelope surround, an’ carried
away a few scalps an’ a lot o’ hosses. Most the hosses
belonged to the fort. Wagh! I bet ye Bridger war
mad! How-some-ever, ’fore this hyar war party got
very fur, with their plunder, the Snakes overtuk ’em,
seized the hosses, killed several warriors an’ wounded
some more. These Injuns warn’t feeling very happy,
coming home licked, an’ they war on the ready for
revenge o’ any kind that happened. Red an’ white
scalps air alike to Injuns in that frame o’ mind; everybody’s
an enemy. But look at that ’ere Snake woman.
She’s b’iling under her blanket!”</p>

<p>Apart, secluded at the edge of the grove, with her
blanket drawn entirely over herself and two children,
crouched the Snake widow, motionless.</p>

<p>The band of Cheyennes and Arapahoes—two tribes
who called one another cousin—stayed here until sunset;
then they rode away; and then the Snake woman
emerged from her blanket, and glaring after them
shook her fist, at these the enemies of her people.</p>

<p>That night double guards were placed; however,
the camp slept unmolested, here 200 miles from Fort
St. Vrain.</p>

<p>The road this next day was very rough; and during
the next day the roughness increased, with dense sage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
interminable, blocking the way. To the north uplifted
a divide forming the Sweetwater Valley of the Oregon
Trail. Therefore diverging from the west into the
north, and abandoning the unseen trail over which, in
less than a score of years, would hasten the stages
from Denver to Salt Lake, the Frémont and Carson
men marched across Great Divide Basin of southern
Wyoming for the familiar country of the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>In a cold rain storm, the evening of August 9, they
camped beside the Sweetwater River, about twenty
miles above the famous Devil’s Gate. From St.
Vrain’s Fort they had travelled 315 miles.</p>

<small>THE EMIGRANT TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>To be beside the friendly guiding Sweetwater was
a great relief. Now the South Pass was only eighty or
ninety miles west, with a plain trail connecting. But
what a trail this had become, in a short year! So
many wagons had traversed it—the hoofs of the oxen
and of the horses all pointing west—that the tough
sage-brush had been crushed flat in a great, winding
furrow forever leading onward. Strange was it to
come upon such a trail, in this wilderness of plain and
butte more than a thousand miles from the frontier.</p>

<p>This morning, when daylight revealed the sudden
highway, exclamations of astonishment ran through
the camp and adown the column, as now the march was
made so much easier.</p>

<p>“Wagh! The Snake woman says it air the great
medicine road o’ the whites,” remarked William New.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if all the folks in Missouri were
moving out to Oregon,” called back Ike.</p>

<p>“You would think so, if you had been with us at
the start,” responded Basil Lajeunesse, who was riding
to chat with the Carson men. “Oregon and California
both. Name of a dog! Until the trail forked and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
turned off for St. Vrain the Laramie route was a string
of beads, so thick were wagons. That Doctor Whitman,
he has stirred people up. One thousand for Oregon—men
and women and the children—were collected
at the Kansas, waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“These air fresh sign,” quoth Ike, with an eye
upon the hoof marks and wheel tracks, and the freshly
plucked springs where women and children must have
wandered, picking nosegays.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Frémont, he stirred people up, too,”
continued Basil, proudly. “It is ‘South Pass,’ ‘South
Pass,’ everybody talk about ‘South Pass,’ so easy to
cross. And the Congress talk, too, all about Oregon,
and it say it will give to every American settler in
Oregon six hundred forty acres of land and for his
child one hundred sixty acres. I should like to go,
myself, but I do not know as my family like to go.”</p>

<p>“Some’ll never get thar,” grunted William New.
“Thar’s a grave, already. Wonder the wolves or the
Injuns haven’t dug it open yet. They will.”</p>

<p>The South Pass was crossed. Still onward led the
great trail. Occasionally at camping-spot or elsewhere
relics were to be noted. Once Oliver found a ragged
doll; and was seen again a hasty grave.</p>

<p>The Big Sandy creek, at the foot of the pass,
where a year before the camp had been made ere
turning north to climb the Peak, was left behind, and
now ahead waited new country.</p>

<p>On August 15—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thar’s the Green,” announced Oliver’s faithful
mentor, William New. “We’re pretty high in Mexican
territory, too. Some say it reaches up this fur, west o’
the mountains, along the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rio Verde</span>. Seedskeedee
River air what she’s called by the Crows—which means
peerairie-hen river.”</p>

<p>The river was about 400 yards wide. The road
forded it at a shallow place, and turned down along it.
The current flowed among wooded islands.</p>

<p>That night, at camp, Lieutenant Frémont much
discussed the river with Kit Carson and Basil Lajeunesse
and Mr. Preuss and others.</p>

<p>“This must be the same as the Buenaventura, or
Good-Fortune River of the early Spanish,” asserted
the lieutenant. “That is, if it has a branch emptying
into the Pacific.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of any,” answered Kit Carson.
“Did you, Basil?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi,</span> not I,” declared Basil, promptly. “But
I never have been beyond, where lies the desert.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I have,” resumed Kit. “I’ve been west
down the Mary’s River to its end in the Sinks; and
I’ve been on the lower end o’ this hyar Green—or what
mout be this hyar Green, whar it’s called the
Colorado.”</p>

<p>“What’s below, Kit?” queried the lieutenant,
quickly. “I hear strange stories of fine valleys at the
bottoms of canyons entered by a secret trail, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wonderful beaver grounds and ancient towns, shut in
by walls a mile high.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled Kit, “when I went out to Californy
in Twenty-nine, with Captain Young, we struck
the Colorado at a place whar the river’d sunk down
into a canyon full a mile deep an’ three mile acrost.
We didn’t get down into it, but I’m ready to believe
that ’most anything could be found at the bottom.
They call it the Grand Canyon, now. Injuns say thar’s
a heap more o’ the same kind, up above, for three hundred
mile.”</p>

<p>“But did you ever hear anything about the Buenaventura
River, flowing west instead of south, across
the Great Basin and emptying into the Pacific Ocean?”</p>

<p>“Heard about it, but never saw it,” stated Kit.
“Never knew a trapper who did see it. O’ course,
Injuns give out all sort o’ tales, an’ you can’t believe
’em.”</p>

<p>“The early Spanish claimed such a river, did they
not—draining a lake?” put in Mr. Preuss. “It is
marked down on maps that I have seen.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the lieutenant. “Now, if there is
such a river, as the Buenaventura, connecting this central
Great Basin with the Pacific Ocean of California,
what a boon will it be! Boats could ascend the
Arkansas, or the Platte, or the Missouri River, be
carried across the mountains, and launching into the
Buenaventura continue on to the coast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“A water-way across the continent,” puffed Mr.
Preuss. “That is good!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien, bien!</span>” cried Basil.</p>

<p>From the Green the road crossed among hills,
making westward for the Bear. Soon the Snake
woman, with her two children and her six pack-horses,
left to seek relatives at the trading post of old Jim
Bridger, only a few miles away. And the next day Kit
Carson spurred ahead, for Fort Hall, to engage provisions
there, in case that the Thomas Fitzpatrick
party, which should be somewhere on the way from
Fort Laramie, might be running short or have met
with misfortune.</p>

<p>However, that very evening provisions walked in
of themselves—being a cow and her calf. They must
have escaped from some emigrant party; and they were
made more of even than had been the red ox—for the
cow gave milk in abundance. Here was luxury: milk
for coffee. So they took the mother and child along
with them.</p>

<p>Early in the second morning thereafter the company
entered the beautiful valley of what Ike and
William and all said was the Bear River. Below but a
short distance were the “Beer Springs” and the
“Steamboat Spring”; and further below was the
Great Salty Lake.</p>

<p>That they would visit the springs was certain, because
the trail led past them; but whether they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
visit the lake was not so certain, although Basil, reporting
to the Carson men, assured:</p>

<p>“We will. I think we will. I hear the lieutenant
and Mr. Preuss talking so. That is why we brought
again the boat.”</p>

<p>“Boat!” snorted Ike. “Another o’ them rubber
contraptions?”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien encore,</span>” confirmed Basil. “It is ready in
the packs. Like the other but not so big.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grumbled William New. “Thought
I smelt it!”</p>

<p>Oliver wished much to ask questions about the
springs, but he knew that if he waited he would find
out everything, whereas if he asked he would likely
be filled with trapper yarns. Besides, it was the part
of a greenhorn to put many foolish questions. However,
William New did remark, as they rode along:</p>

<p>“That ’ere springs basin ahead’ll make you think
you’re in the infernal regions. Red rock an’ blue rock
an’ green trees, an’ hot water an’ cold, an’ sulphur
smells an’ noises. Wagh!”</p>

<p>Emigrants, making a large and happy encampment,
were passed; and still more, encamped or moving, their
white-topped wagons showing finely. The men were
dressed in flannel or calico shirts, jeans and boots; the
women in calico; the children, chiefly barefoot, in
material of various makeshift kinds: and everybody
was happy and hopeful and well, eager to talk of
“Oregon” or of “Californy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“How far to Oregon, strangers?” asked one of the
men.</p>

<p>“You’re in it!” answered the lieutenant, laughing.
“Anywhere above forty-two degrees latitude, west of
the South Pass, is Oregon!”</p>

<p>Some Snake Indians, riding the trail, met the company
and told the lieutenant that a large village of their
fellows had just come in from antelope hunting and
berry gathering, and were camped near by. These
Snakes appeared to be open-hearted, friendly Indians.
They shook hands with Ike and the other trappers; and
as Oliver well knew, Snakes and trappers were good
friends, always, united against the Blackfeet and the
Sioux. In fact, the Indians west of the South Pass
were to be counted upon as friendlies—except the
Diggers.</p>

<p>“Watch out for the Diggers, or they’ll slip an
arrow into ye, sure,” had warned William New.</p>

<p>So, this being Snake country, the lieutenant rode
aside to pay a visit to the Snake village. But as they
came in sight of it, a mile away in a pretty little
bottom-land beside a stream, out from the cluster of
skin lodges sped a horseman—and another, and another,
and squad after squad, charging into the open,
before.</p>

<p>“Look out, boys!” rang the voice of Lieutenant
Frémont, galloping down the line. And—“Get that
howitzer ready!” he ordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those Injuns ’most crazy, I think,” muttered
Basil, aiding the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Wagh! Looks like we’ll be gone beaver, if we
don’t watch out,” called Ike. “What’s the matter with
the fools, I wonder.”</p>

<p>The Snakes evidently were in battle array. They
were fully armed, with bows and lances and guns;
many were almost wholly naked, save for the great
war bonnets which floated their red, yellow and white
feathers far behind the racing horses. In a solid, yelling
mass they came on, while in the village women and
children scuttled into the brush. Suddenly, ere a shot
had been fired, the foremost of the Snakes raised his
hand; his warriors slackened, and he rode forward,
to where the white men were formed for peace or war.</p>

<p>The Snake chief explained that his people had seen
the flag, and that as their enemies the Sioux and the
Blackfeet were accustomed to bear a flag of some
kind they had supposed that this was an attack. He
was glad that no shots had been fired, for the Snakes
never had spilled the blood of a white man.</p>

<p>This explanation was satisfactory, and escorted by
a dense throng of the Indians the Frémont and Carson
men rode on to the Snake village.</p>

<p>The chief pointed out a spot, by the village, where
the company should camp; and then in a loud voice
announced to the Indians that the white chief wished
to buy horses. Many speedily were driven up by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
owners, and for beads and tobacco and knives and red
and blue cloth eight were taken over.</p>

<p>The kettles were on the lodge fires, as always is
the case in an Indian camp. The atmosphere was filled
with a peculiar odor. Ike and William New and the
other Carson trappers, and some of the Frémont
men also, sniffed as if pleased; and Oliver sniffed, but
pretended not to be curious. This odor was like to
decayed apples—and evidently so thought Mr. Preuss
the bristly-headed, red-faced German, as he bustled
about.</p>

<p>“What is that? Rotted apples!” he exclaimed,
wrinkling his nose disgustedly. “Where do you suppose
these Snakes got apples. I declare!”</p>

<p>“That smell?” responded Ike. “That’s kooyah.
That’s the finest grub out: kooyah root. Hyar—try
some.”</p>

<p>A squaw was bringing, evidently as a gift, a steaming
platter of yellowish substance that might have
been mashed sweet-potatoes; she presented it to Ike
with a smile. Mr. Preuss took some upon the point
of his hunting-knife. He gingerly tasted it.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he spat. “Tastes worse than it smells.
What do you call it, you say?”</p>

<p>“Kooyah root. But what’s the matter with yuh—wasting
good food like that. I tell ’ee, it air prime
fodder; it air prime, baked or b’iled, an’ with that in
yore meat-bag you can travel fur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“The most horrid stuff I ever put in my mouth,”
retorted Mr. Preuss, as he left.</p>

<p>The Carson men afterwards learned that the chief
sent to the Frémont lodge, where Mr. Preuss also
had quarters, a kettle of the kooyah as a compliment,
and that the German was driven by it into the open air.
During the march through the Snake country the
camps made sport for themselves by slyly sticking some
of the kooyah messes under Mr. Preuss’ nose; whereat
he always fled.</p>

<p>However, all the others, even the lieutenant, liked
the kooyah, which was called in English “tobacco
root,” and in scientific language, according to the
lieutenant and Mr. Preuss, “valerian.”</p>

<p>The Oregon emigrant trail led westward, down
the Bear, between high hills and through immense
areas of blue flax now going to seed. Along the trail
were travelling, at irregular intervals, squads of emigrants,
with their wagons and cattle, either camping or
on the move for the day’s march. The main caravan
was still some distance ahead, under personal leadership
of Dr. Whitman.</p>

<p>“Yonder, over that fust ridge,” directed William
New, to Oliver, at their next mess fire, “air the Beer
Springs an’ the Steamboat Spring. Wagh! That’ll
surprise ye—an’ it’ll give that German something
to think of besides kooyah.”</p>

<p>“Do they taste?” queried Oliver.</p>

<p>“Taste, boy! Thar’s a heap o’ tastes! But that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Beer Spring group air fine. O’ course they air a drink
that don’t hurt ye; but we trappers claim they make you
feel like dancing Injun, jest the same. I ’xpect it air
the gas, tickling yore insides. If all the drinks in the
world war no wuss’n these hyar Beer Springs, made
by nature, the world’d be better off. So don’t think,
’cause we old-timers named ’em in fun, that thar’s anything
wrong with ’em. Sody Springs they’re called,
too.”</p>

<p>The springs were located in a basin enclosed by a
semicircle of rugged mountain-crests, on the one hand,
and by the river on the other. First, pieces of lava were
to be noted, beside the trail; then came the springs
themselves—hundreds of them, bubbling and welling
from the green and red and white and yellow ground.
Many of them had made little cones, of bright colors;
and even the current of the river boiled and frothed
with the gas.</p>

<p>Everybody quaffed deeply of the waters, which
sparkled and bubbled, clear and luke-warm, from the
rocks and the tufts of grass.</p>

<p>“Hi yah! Hi yah!” capered William New, ridiculously.
“Hyar’s doings! This chile wants to dance.
Hi yah!”</p>

<p>But he was only pretending, after the fashion of the
place.</p>

<p>If anybody was not satisfied with a spring, all he
had to do was to walk a few steps, and dig with his
heel or with a stick, and he would open up a new spring—sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with a slightly different taste. Down
stream about half a mile was the most remarkable
spring of all: the Steamboat Spring. From a red crack
in a rock right at the bank of the river, and beside the
trail, spurted a jet of steamy water, rising and falling;
a couple of yards from it, from a small round hole
puffed jets of steamy air; and water and air together
made a noise like the sighing “choo choo!” of a
steamboat.</p>

<small>TO THE GREAT SALTY LAKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now I wonder,” mused William New, “what
that ’ere lieutenant’s planning next. S’pose you jest
take a little walk over to t’other camp an’ see.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>It was noon, and only a short distance from the
camp at the Beer Springs, on the day before, the expedition
had again halted.</p>

<p>“’Cause this air the jumping-off place. If we follow
the trail, we go on northwest for Fort Hall, ’bout
fifty miles down the Portneuf to the Snake. If we
follow the B’ar, we turn sharp south, for the lake,
which air more’n two hundred miles. An’ I ’xpect
that’s what we do,” he exclaimed. “Yon goes that
fellow Lee, lickity. Bet you he’s an express to Fort
Hall, to tell Kit.”</p>

<p>A horseman had dashed away from the Frémont
quarters, to disappear down the trail. His own curiosity
aroused, Oliver obediently strode across to the
Frémont camp. He met François Lajeunesse, who
was visibly excited.</p>

<p>“What’s up, François?”</p>

<p>“We go to the Great Salty Lake,” informed François,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
who was brother to Basil. “The lieutenant, he
would explore the Great Salty Lake—perhaps sail on
it. He has sent Henri Lee to tell Kit Carson to come
back quick from Fort Hall, with provisions.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been there, François?”</p>

<p>“I? Never! Nor Basil, either. No, not anybody
in the whole company. But I have heard of it. It is
true—a great salty lake, with not an outlet and with
fresh water flowing into it!”</p>

<p>Oliver hastened back to spread the news.</p>

<p>“Wagh!” murmured William New, satisfied.
“That lake air thar, but it’s pore beaver country, an’
I never cared to fool with it. It war discovered in
winter o’ Twenty-four an’ Five by old Jim Bridger, to
settle a dispute as to whar the B’ar emptied. Jim set
out in a skin canoe from trapper winter-camp in Cache
Valley, below hyar, an’ he went fur ’nough to see the
lake an’ taste it too. He said it war part o’ the Pacific
Ocean; an’ trappers believed that till in spring o’
Twenty-six four o’ Cap’n Bill Sublette’s men found it
ag’in an’ paddled ’round its edge looking for beaver
streams. Didn’t discover any, an’ so the lake warn’t
any use. Don’t believe even Kit’s paid much attention
to it.”</p>

<p>During the rest of this day, and through the evening,
there was constant talk of the Great Salty Lake.
Everybody, French and American, was highly interested
in reaching it. Provisions were so low that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Henry Lee had been despatched to hasten Kit Carson
from Fort Hall; however, the little cow and her calf
were still on hand, for emergency, and this very day
two more calves were picked up, where they had
strayed from some emigrant outfit.</p>

<p>The emigrant trail left the Bear, and continued
on to the northwest; but the Bear itself turned short,
at right angle, and flowed for the south. It was to be
the guide to the Great Salty Lake, and the march of the
expedition turned with it.</p>

<p>Only some 200 miles before awaited the lake—a
mysterious, desolate place, according to reports; as
large as a sea, connecting with the ocean by means
of a tremendous whirl-pool in its centre that sucked
all creatures down, and containing islands inhabited
by giants with enormous clubs. Indians said that such
clubs had been found, on the shore, after storms!</p>

<p>Cranes were seen flying, as if the lake might be
close; but they evidently were only seeking a slough
which bordered the river a few miles beyond. Here
were quantities of geese and ducks, but very wild and
unaccommodating. The arrival of Kit Carson, with
supplies, was eagerly looked for.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and Basil Lajeunesse, exploring
ahead, following an Indian trail which turned west
from the Bear came upon more Snake Indians, who by
sign talk said that this trail would lead to a fine broad
valley running north and south. As the route along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the Bear was hilly and swampy, the march was changed
to this trail. It conducted through a beautiful little
pass, where between twain huge gates of solid rock,
amidst flowers and shrubs and many tender trees
rippled merrily a pure mountain stream—civilly leaving
space for guests to enter and depart.</p>

<p>The pass formed a little valley, long and narrow;
adown it came riding a gaily bedecked squaw, with half
a dozen dogs; thrown into sudden terror by the spectacle
of this white man’s cavalcade she raced away as
fast as her horse could carry her. Because of a singular
rock column, planted almost in the centre of the
little valley, the place was named the Pass of the
Standing Rock.</p>

<p>Beyond the Pass of the Standing Rock was encountered
another village of the Snakes. When the lieutenant
wished to trade for roots, the Indians opened
their blankets and showed him how bony were their
bodies.</p>

<p>“If we sell to you, we shall starve; see, how thin
we are, already!”</p>

<p>So that night there was nothing left to do but to
kill the faithful little cow; and this was ordered.</p>

<p>The Shoshonies or Snakes of the village said that
the great salty water was only two sleeps south. The
next day the march arrived at the Roseaux or Reed
River, which is separated from the Bear by a mountain
ridge; and down the Roseaux they turned. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
midst of the cold rain, this night, entered their camp
a cringing, starved dog with a bullet-wound in his
side. Oliver made much of him, and fed him some
scraps and let him sleep on the foot of the buffalo-robe.</p>

<p>The water of the River of Weeds, which is known
also as the Malade, or Sick River, tasted salty, as if in
token that the lake was near. Through a canyon in
the divide the Bear River broke through into the
valley, and presently the two rivers joined, with the
expedition caught in the angle between them. The
country was growing more and more mysterious, with
much reeds and cane growth and willow thickets, and
flight of water-fowl. In the distance ahead the valley
opened wide; above the level line of the swamps rose
several hazy outcrops, like enchanted islands floating
upon the horizon. And islands they indeed were: for
the level line was the basin of the great lake.</p>

<p>Now the rubber boat was unpacked. It was not so
ill-smelling as the rubber boat of last summer, and
was in the shape of a canoe about eighteen feet long.
The gunwales and the bows must be inflated, to stiffen
the boat. Although Ike and William New and other
Carson men, and some of the Frémont men also,
viewed the craft askance, and poked fun at it, right
here it came in very handy, for by it was all the camp
baggage ferried across the mouth of the Roseaux;
even the cannon was thus carried. The men and the
horses swam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking the bold Basil Lajeunesse as companion, the
lieutenant re-embarked in the boat, for a voyage down
the Bear. He thought it possible that in this way he
would reach the lake. His company were to continue
on, by land.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant and Basil, in the frail boat, disappeared
around the first bend of the reedy channel there
was grave shaking of heads over the venture.</p>

<p>“The seams are only pasted when they should
have been sewed. It is a weaker boat than that of
last year.”</p>

<p>“Thar air critters in the swamps lower down that’ll
swallow boat an’ all, ’cording to Injun say.”</p>

<p>“Sech doin’s don’t shine with this coon. He wishes
he war back at old Touse, he does.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span> Suppose they two come to the place
where the river runs from under them so that they
sink in the mud! And then the people with web feet
like ducks will get them!”</p>

<p>The march proceeded, down along the course of the
Bear. All day, by horse and foot, tugging the spring-wagon
and the gun-carriage, they plodded. Gradually
the country changed, becoming more and more desolate
and forbidding. In places the river seemed to be
higher than the surface upon either side: sluggishly
rolling between banks like welts it spread out into salt
marshes harboring thousands of water fowl—ducks,
geese, cranes, herons, pelicans, gulls, curlew, plover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Where the water had evaporated under the sun the
bare soil gleamed white, and was covered with small
shells. Only a few twisted shrubs and short blackened
willows rose above the drear, dead expanse.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the camp was pitched among
willow clumps. The lieutenant and Basil had not
appeared, and nothing had been seen of the boat.
Many were the dire predictions, and François, Basil’s
brother, was well-nigh frantic. Over the wide salt
swamps the sun set strangely yellow, his glow casting
a ghastly light upon all objects. But a cheer rang
forth, for trudging along the river came the lieutenant
and Basil.</p>

<p>They were wet and tired and hungry. The boat
had moved slowly upon the heavy current which swept
along in a winding course of many curves and doublings;
so finally they had left the craft behind cached
in some willows, and clambering out upon the bank
had trailed the company afoot, for three hours.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning Basil started back,
with a small party, all on horseback, to get the boat;
they returned in the afternoon, bringing not only the
boat but some roots and bear-meat for which they had
traded with the Diggers.</p>

<p>“Shoshonies and Shoshokies—they air same Injuns
made different by the way they live,” declared
William New to Oliver. “You see, when they air rich
an’ have hosses, like the Snakes, they call themselves
Shoshonies; an’ when they air pore an’ miser’ble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
an’ go afoot, they air called Shoshokies. Out on the
desert, west o’ hyar, these Root Diggers air so pore
they wear a rabbit-skin for winter blanket, an’ they eat
beetles an’ grass-hoppers an’ rats. Wagh! But they
use p’isened arrows, an’ they’re wuss in a fight than
bigger Injuns.”</p>

<p>As the march proceeded the water-fowl increased,
until when disturbed they arose with fast flutter of
wings that boomed like thunder. Soon the blind trail
was cut by an impassible morass through which drained
the water of the river. Here camp must be made.
They decided that this was the mouth of the Bear, and
that now the great lake began; but they could not see
over the willows and rushes, they could not advance,
and therefore they must turn back and seek better
approach.</p>

<p>Ten days had passed since Henry Lee had left
on the emigrant trail for Fort Hall, to carry word to
Kit Carson. Kit had not come, and some of the men
were beginning to grumble over the lack of provisions.
To be sure, for the last two or three days there had
been plenty of ducks and geese and plover; but the
birds were wild and to hunt them down, in the marshes,
was hard work. Why didn’t Carson get in, with
grub? Maybe he wasn’t coming at all; maybe he was
lost, or the Injuns had stampeded him.</p>

<p>“You fellows don’t know Kit,” reproved Ike.
“He’ll come, straight an’ quick, if he got the word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“With me, Carson and truth are the same thing,”
asserted Lieutenant Frémont. “I have found that you
can depend on him absolutely.”</p>

<p>And hurrah! This very morning, as the camp
was packing to turn back, in rode Kit, with a pack-animal.</p>

<p>He had done the best that he could, but he had
brought only a little flour, and a moderate quantity
of lesser provisions.</p>

<p>“Fitzpatrick hadn’t come in, yet,” announced Kit;
“but the fort’s alive with emigrants. They’ve all collected
thar, holding a pow-wow, whether to go on with
their wagons an’ cattle, or with packs. Jest as I left,
that man Whitman arrived, from down the trail, an’
he war making a speech, telling ’em he’d take ’em
through, wagons an’ all, or bust. Anyway, they’ve
stripped the post o’ supplies.”</p>

<p>All were glad to see Kit again; and he was eager
to see the lake. The new trail wound along the bases
of the range of hills on the east, until it turned into a
gorge or canyon from which issued a river—the
Weber River, with sparkling current flowing rapidly
between high wooded banks. The cavalcade left the
trail, and followed the river, for the mystic lake.</p>

<p>Camp must be made before the lake was sighted.
The next morning the march was resumed, this time
straight for a shoulder or butte which rose plain in
view across the open, brushy flat. And on this morning
of September 6, 1843, climbing the butte the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
breathless company—Boy Oliver no more excited than
Lieutenant Frémont or Kit Carson themselves—gazed
out over the Great Salty Lake, at last.</p>

<p>Silent it lay, sluggishly heaving, its shores uninhabited
and bare. No city of Ogden anear floated
upon the clear air the smoke plumes of man’s supremacy;
no Mormon plough had yet stirred the soil by
the River Jordan, nor had Mormon trowel laid a single
brick of the capital of the State of Utah. The lonely
waves washed heavily the whitened lonely beach; the
wide lonely surface was broken by but two or three
high rocky islands, blue in distance. Beyond, at the
far extremity of this inland sea, lifted vague peaks;
eyries from whose lofty crags as from a watch-tower
peered abroad the couchant genie of the place.</p>

<p>Kit Carson, his weather-beaten face sober, from the
saddle scanned intently. As he stood leaning upon his
rifle, Lieutenant Frémont’s bold blue eyes flashed with
triumph, and his hawk-nose jutted the more dominantly.
Scarcely a word was spoken. All were too
excited and too absorbed to cheer.</p>

<p>Then, as they gazed, down from those eyries beyond
swooped in guise of big black clouds (as in the
Arabian Nights) the guardians of this secret spot.
They poured from the distant mountain-tops across the
darkening water, and with furiously swirling draperies
covered islands and everything.</p>

<p>“Wagh!” muttered William New. “Better be
getting out o’ hyar! Spirits air angry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll make camp in that first grove, up the river,”
said Lieutenant Frémont. “And to-morrow we’ll put
things in shape for a trip on the lake. There’s a lot of
work to be done, in the way of surveying it.”</p>

<p>Driven backward by the thunder-storm, they retired
to a grove of great poplars, about nine miles
inland from the butte.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a><br />
<small>SAILING THE INLAND SEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The night settled clear and calm, with scarce a
breath of air to sough through the pendent leaves of
the stately poplars. But the moonlit atmosphere was
rife with strange sighings and moanings and whisperings,
as from the ghostly lake out of sight below the
camp. These sounds may have been water-fowl;
William New and other trappers and voyageurs in
both parties said that they were “spirits” and “medicine”;
Jacob Dodson, the young colored man, said
that they were “mighty like ha’nts”; and the wounded
dog, which now was recovering, whined and shivered
and snuggled closer upon Oliver’s buffalo robe.</p>

<p>In spite of the sounds real and imaginary the camp
was safe and whole at day-break. The lieutenant put
everybody at work cutting timber with which to make
a horse-pen and a fort. In the midst of these preparations
Ike Chamberlain sought out Kit Carson, and
addressed him freely.</p>

<p>“Say, Kit, what’s the meaning o’ this hyar? Must
be going to stay awhile.”</p>

<p>“Going to stay till the lieutenant gets through,
Ike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, he’s not our boss. We’re an independent
consarn.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you are, Ike. So what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“We’ve ’bout decided that staying hyar an’ living
on roots an’ feathers whilst a crazy man measures that
thar lake doesn’t shine with us fellows. Thar air no
fur an’ no meat hyar, an’ snow air creeping down the
hills. We want to get out whilst we can.”</p>

<p>“I won’t stop you, Ike.”</p>

<p>“You come too.”</p>

<p>“Not an inch. I engaged to Lieutenant Frémont,
an’ I’m going through.”</p>

<p>“On that ’ere lake, in that ’ere boat, Kit?”</p>

<p>“I shorely am, Ike, if the lieutenant asks me to.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Kit, don’t you do it,” implored
Ike, much concerned. “Thar’s a whirlpool that’ll
swallow you, boat an’ all. If the lake has nary river
draining it off, how does it keep from overflowing,
with these rivers running in! Must drain by a whirlpool,
which sucks the water off fast as it comes in.
Mebbe thar air cannibals on those islands, to gobble ye
soon as ye land. Besides, whar’s the grub for the
crowd? What you fetched down from Hall is ’bout
gone already, an’ we’ll soon be living wuss’n Root Diggers.
When the snows fall lower we’ll be shut in to
starve. ’Tain’t a fit country for white man; ’tain’t,
Kit. We’re going to pull out, an’ you’d better come
with us. If that lieutenant wants to stay an’ make
figgers, let him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go if you want to, Ike. I stay with Frémont,”
answered Kit Carson, evenly. “He expects me to, and
I will. I can’t ask you Touse men to. There won’t
be much fun in it, for you, especially if we push on for
the coast by winter trail down the Snake.”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Ike. “Jest to get figgers? No,
siree. I reckon we’ll pack back through the mountains,
whar thar’s fur an’ meat, for Laramie, Kit.”</p>

<p>“All right, Ike. When you get to Touse tell Josefa
I’m well.” And Kit turned away.</p>

<p>Oliver heard this conversation, and was aghast.
Back to Taos? Never! He hastened after Kit and
appealed to him:</p>

<p>“Do I have to go, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Whar, boy?”</p>

<p>“Back, with Ike and the rest.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’d better. Times air liable to be hard
on the trail, an’ we’re bound through to Vancouver.”</p>

<p>“But I want to stay, Kit. I’ll feed myself—I’ll
do my own foraging—I’d just as soon eat roots, I
like ’em. I want to stay, with you and Lieutenant
Frémont—and sail on the lake—and go to the coast.
I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Not afraid to explore that ’ere lake in that rubber
contraption, an’ get swallowed by a whirlpool,
mebbe?”</p>

<p>“No,” declared Oliver, stanchly.</p>

<p>“Wall,” smiled Kit Carson, his clear gray-blue
eyes twinkling, “if Ike an’ the rest should happen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ride off an’ you shouldn’t be with ’em, I s’pose we’d
have to keep you, best we could. You’ve got yore dog,
to eat.”</p>

<p>To the wise a word is sufficient. Ike and William
New and all the Carson squad swiftly packed, to take
the trail. The Frémont men cast sidelong glance as
they proceeded with their own duties, and some, amidst
the bantering, hinted that they would like to go, too.
But they were under orders: enlisted for this United
States Army service. The Taos men were free trappers,
enlisted not at all.</p>

<p>“Ready, boy?” called William New, to Oliver.</p>

<p>“I want to wait and see the boat start,” answered
Oliver. “Go on; I can trail you.”</p>

<p>“You’d better do it in a hurry, then,” grumbled
William New, as he mounted. “We’re heading for
beaver an’ buff’ler, an’ we travel fast.”</p>

<p>Without another word off they rode, two by two,
at trapper rack or single-foot; and following up the
Weber Fork they disappeared among the hills.</p>

<p>Oliver sauntered about, and at the first opportunity
took a hand in rolling logs.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going, boy?” demanded Lieutenant
Frémont, suddenly noting him.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Wouldn’t they take you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I’d rather stay with you and Kit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.” And the lieutenant, out of careworn
bearded face, eyed him calculatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to sail in the boat, on the lake, if there’s
room,” ventured Oliver. “I wouldn’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said the lieutenant.
“I don’t know but what you’d better go on up to Fort
Hall with François and party. I’m sending them, in
a minute or two, so as to cut down the drain on the
supplies.”</p>

<p>“I’d—like—to—stay,” faltered Oliver. “Kit said
I could eat my dog—but maybe I won’t have to.”</p>

<p>“You’re liable to eat worse than dog, if you do
stay,” warned the lieutenant, with a sudden smile
lighting his countenance. And he added: “But stay
you shall. You’re a brave lad, and I like courage.”</p>

<p>The horse corral and the little fort, both of cottonwood
or poplar trunks, were finished; and in the latter
was mounted the battered but faithful brass howitzer.
Nobody might tell yet how many Indians, perhaps
Utes, perhaps Snakes, perhaps Root Diggers, perhaps
strangers more savage, might be spying and planning
attack upon these few invaders; so precautions were
taken. This being done, François Lajeunesse and
some others were told off by the lieutenant, to go back
up the Bear and on to Fort Hall, there to wait.</p>

<p>After François and companions left, the Carson-Frémont
camp on the Weber River consisted of the
lieutenant and Kit, Basil Lajeunesse, Baptiste Bernier,
Baptiste Derosier, François Badeau, Mr. Preuss, Jacob
Dodson the young colored man, and Oliver. Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Zindel had started with the François squad, but Jacob
knew how to handle the gun.</p>

<p>The day was spent in patching and strengthening
the rubber boat, in making scientific observations, and
in exploring the country near at hand. The sunset was
beautiful, orange and green, reflected in the waters of
the great lake—a sunset so peculiar that it might
have been enchantment by a wizard, testing his spells
after the frowns of the genie had failed. However,
nobody was afraid of the wizard, and the supper of
yampa roots and a fat duck which Jacob had shot
tasted good. The spells by a stout heart are much
stronger than any spells by any wizard.</p>

<p>It was planned that the next day a voyage should
be made to the nearest of the islands. Neither Kit
Carson nor Lieutenant Frémont put much stock in
tales of whirlpool and ravenous monsters and club-bearing
giants—although, of course, who could say!
But they hoped to find upon the islands flowers and
fruits and crystal streams and much game, never before
witnessed by human being.</p>

<p>Jacob, and François Badeau and Baptiste Derosier
had been named to garrison the little fort. After
an early breakfast the lieutenant and Kit, Mr. Preuss
and Basil and Baptiste Bernier busied themselves in
packing the boat, tied to the river-bank, with blankets
and scientific instruments and three rubber bags of
water and a little food.</p>

<p>“Wall, boy,” remarked Kit Carson, with a twinkle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
eyeing Oliver, who lingered near, “looks as though
you’d better stay ashore.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” queried the lieutenant, overhearing.
“Oh, I guess we can make room. By all means.
He climbed the highest peak, and I think he ought to
be one to explore the enchanted islands. Come along,
lad. You can pump the bellows and keep her blown
up.”</p>

<p>And Oliver needed no second invitation.</p>

<p>The sun was just appearing over the mountain
ranges in the east when, on this the eighth of September,
the rubber canoe left her moorings and started
down the river, for the lake. The men paddled; Oliver
was set at work pumping air into the inflated cylinders,
along gunwales and bows, for they leaked.</p>

<p>It was a delightful voyage. Frequently, at
warning hiss from the paddlers before, they all floated
silently, in order to get a shot at a duck or goose;
to shoot it in the head, of course, if possible. These
pauses, and the halts to pick up the game, consumed
time, so that when the river channel opened out upon
the lake-shore evening was near.</p>

<p>At the lake-shore the river made a kind of swamp,
traversed in several places by a shallow, slow current.
The boat stuck in the mud, and its crew must get out
and shove her and haul her along, in mud to their
knees. Finally, at a little point of dry land, amidst
willows and reeds, where there was plenty of drift-wood,
camp was made. The supper menu was roasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ducks and plover and geese—and the breakfast menu
was the same.</p>

<p>All night the hoarse voices of wild-fowl, in marsh
and upon lake, kept the air vibrant with multitudinous
sound. However, upon their low beds of willow-branches
and rushes the little camp by the unknown
inland sea slept safely, until, at the first touch of pink
in the eastern sky, the cheery tone of Lieutenant Frémont
aroused with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leve, leve!</span>”—the trappers’ signal
to arise.</p>

<p>This was the day for the voyage upon the salty
lake. Oliver felt a strange wonderment and exhilaration:
he felt like crying “Hooray!” The lieutenant
was all energy, and even Kit Carson was more talkative
than customary, while Mr. Preuss scarcely
chewed his food before swallowing it—so excited was
he. But Basil and Baptiste were unusually quiet, even
to seeming downcast.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you two boys—you and
Baptiste?” demanded the lieutenant, of Basil. “Are
you afraid, so soon?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur lieutenant,” responded Basil.
“Only, we have had a bad dream, Baptiste and I. It
means evil. Now, if we could but postpone the voyage
until to-morrow—— To-day is unlucky.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” reproved the lieutenant. “Did you
dream, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Kit, “sometimes I have bad dreams an’
sometimes I have good dreams; an’ sometimes after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the bad dreams I have the best luck, an’ sometimes
after the good dreams I have the worst luck. So I’ve
come to depend more on what I do when I’m awake
than on what I do when I’m asleep.”</p>

<p>“Anybody can dream, but it takes a man to do,”
spoke the German, Mr. Preuss.</p>

<p>“Well, I sha’n’t govern our operations by dreams,
or we’re liable not to get anywhere,” avowed the lieutenant.
“When we come back from the islands we’ll
laugh at Basil and Baptiste.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we go too,” said both. But they did not
brighten up much.</p>

<p>Only a short distance beyond the place of the camp
the river channels were lost in a great mud-flat covered
by an inch or so of water. Now everybody
stripped to the skin, to haul the boat to the lake, beyond.
At the sight of these strange white creatures the long-legged
plover with which the flat swarmed circled and
screamed. The mud was about the texture of paint,
and when stirred up smelled disgustingly, as if composed
of decaying insects. Speedily the crew were
smeared with the black liquid to the thighs. Behind
them they left a long, discolored, greasy trail.</p>

<p>The unpleasant mud extended for a mile, when
suddenly they came to a little ridge, hard and distinct,
rising underfoot. Here the mud stopped; beyond the
little ridge, which acted as a divide, was firm sandy bottom,
and very salt water—the bottom and the water
of the great lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Now with a cheer they hastily dressed, clambered
aboard, and launched forth—Oliver pumping with the
bellows.</p>

<p>The nearest island seemed to be a low one, rising
to a flat-top instead of to a regular peak. For this
was the boat directed.</p>

<p>The frail rubber boat rode easily the swells of the
light-green, clear water. The pasted seams held well;
the inflated sides and ends lifted her high. But in a
short time she looked queer indeed, as if riding a snow-storm;
for when the swells broke against her they
sprayed salt which turned white in the drying air.
It covered her and her crew, and of Lieutenant Frémont,
with his full beard, it made a hoary old man.</p>

<p>“There’s a current setting southward; see how
the foam patches all drift one way?” said Mr. Preuss.</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span> It is the whirlpool sucking at them!”
muttered Baptiste, tremulously.</p>

<p>“Paddle hard,” encouraged the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Kit had been peering keenly ahead, at the island.
He spoke sharply.</p>

<p>“Captain (he called the lieutenant ‘captain,’ which
was according to trapper custom), what are those yonder?
Just take a look with the glass, won’t you?”</p>

<p>All gazed, half alarmed, while Lieutenant Frémont
levelled his long telescope. Between the boat and the
island was a peculiar fringe of changing white.</p>

<p>“Oh! Those are only waves, Kit,” announced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
lieutenant. “They’re breaking to white-caps. Must
be a breeze coming. Beyond still, on the shore of the
island, is a row of pelicans, I think.”</p>

<p>The breeze soon struck the boat. Riding high, it
made yet slower headway, but it showed no symptoms
of capsizing. A good little craft she was.</p>

<p>“Pump, boy,” bade Kit. “Those thar tanks leak
wuss’n ever.”</p>

<p>And Oliver plied the bellows.</p>

<p>The breeze, fierce and constant as if the wizard or
the genie was blowing with the breath to defeat the
rash intruders, swept directly from the island, until,
shut off by the rocks, it apparently ceased, and the
water was smooth. The row of pelicans proved to be
only rocks whitened by salt.</p>

<p>Now in a few minutes the rubber canoe was gliding
through transparent shallows, and was about to land
at the shelving, level shore.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to carry her up before she touches,
boys,” spoke the lieutenant, leaping overboard, to his
waist. “These sharp rocks will punch a hole in her.”</p>

<p>Overboard sprang all, and hustling the baggage
ashore carried the fragile craft after it.</p>

<p>No giants opposed their landing; no huge figures
rushed from the high sage, and flourished clubs, to
clear the beach. The stretch of shore exhibited no
foot-print, of human, or inhuman, or even of beast.
Save the wash of the waves and the whisk of the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
not a sound arose. By all evidence, the island was a
desert island, uninhabited.</p>

<p>From its high point, where its rocks rose to about
800 feet, the party surveyed its whole surface. Salt
and a gigantic species of greasewood (the only “giant”
thing); another, whitish shrub, some prickly pear, etc.,
were the only inhabitants of the island; salt was deposited
in every crevice and pool; two birds flew from
the mainland, on brief visit; that was all. And because
of the disillusion where they had hoped to find fruits
and flowers and game and sparkling streams, they
christened the island Disappointment Island. Into a
rock of the peak the lieutenant chiselled with his knife
a cross; and by the rock he accidentally left the brass
cap of his telescope.</p>

<p>That night each man (including Oliver) made himself
a little shelter-lodge out of the abundant drift-wood
on the shore, and with feet to the large fires lay down
for slumber. There was no need of any sentry, nor
of hand upon gun. The island was perfectly safe.
To be enabled to sleep without a fear was novel experience,
and was worth the trip.</p>

<p>During the night the wind increased again; and
once Lieutenant Frémont said that the waves sounded
like the surf of the ocean.</p>

<p>In the morning the waves were running high; the
warders of the great lonely lake had still not given up
the fight. Now the wind was from the opposite direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
or off shore, trying to keep the boat to the island!
So again must the crew paddle hard, while Oliver
pumped with the bellows; the lake was rougher than
on the day before; the rubber strained and the ribs
creaked, and Basil and Baptiste croaked dire “I told
you so.” Nevertheless, at noon the shore was reached,
before the promontory butte, and with a glad shout
of exultation and relief they all leaped into the shallows,
to carry baggage and craft high and dry.</p>

<p>But the efforts of the angered lake-guardians were
not spent. While harder blew the gale, it shifted, and
presently it was rolling the lake itself farther and
farther upon the shore! The temporary camp had
been placed about a quarter of a mile from the edge;
but across the mud flat came creeping the water.
When Mr. Preuss arrived with horses from the main
camp up the river there was just time to pack and
mount and ride, before the tide had covered the spot.
When they looked back, the lake was busy wiping out
all traces of their intrusion upon its shores. However,
upon the island in its midst was the chiselled cross,
and the brass cap of the telescope. Another army
man, Captain Howard Stansbury, also of the Topographical
Corps, in 1849 found the cross, but not the
brass cap; the Mormon settlers of the lake shore had
called the island Castle Island; he named it Frémont
Island.</p>

<p>Across a low, sandy, salty plain the late crew of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
rubber boat rode for the log fort. The foiled wizard
or genie who seemed to dwell in those mountains
across the water pursued them with a thunder-storm,
but they outstripped it, and welcomed gladly by the
salute of Jacob’s howitzer they entered the friendly
grove.</p>

<small>ON TO THE COLUMBIA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“You say that the emigrants were going on,
wagons and all, Kit?” queried the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That war the plan. Whitman said he’d get ’em
through, an’ they’d need their goods an’ cattle at t’other
end.”</p>

<p>The little company were on the back trail for Fort
Hall. As Ike Chamberlain had warned, already winter
was creeping down the mountain-sides, with his banners
of white ever investing closer the lowlands. Even
while the explorers had been encamped near the lake,
the snows seemed to have increased upon the crests of
the Wasatch Range, overhead. It was a thousand long
miles to the end of the trail at Vancouver upon the
lower Columbia; therefore Lieutenant Frémont and
Kit Carson agreed that to put in more time hereabouts
was hazardous.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the second day following the
voyage to Disappointment Island the march was begun,
up the Bear and the River of Weeds, for Fort
Hall, six days’ travel with the baggage.</p>

<p>Once more the talk drifted to the amazing pilgrimage
of Oregon emigrants, and the great concourse of
them at Fort Hall, before Kit had left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Hudson Bay people’s policy would be to discourage
settlers, anyway,” mused the lieutenant.
“With settlers in there tilling the ground and showing
the Indians and the Canadians that farming paid better
than fur-hunting, the Company’s business would
suffer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled Kit; “an’ this hyar emigration, if
it goes through, will put more Americans than thar air
British in the Oregon country; an’ if thar’s anything
in settlement of a country it’ll mean a big help to the
United States.”</p>

<p>“It surely will,” affirmed the lieutenant. “Success
in life and in battle means getting there first, and
sticking.”</p>

<p>The route to Fort Hall followed up the Roseaux or
River of Weeds from its juncture with the Bear to its
sources. Here galloped into camp a horseman from
the north—Baptiste Tabeau, of the Thomas Fitzpatrick
party. Baptiste, shaking hands right and left,
brought the news that the White Head, with all well,
was but a short distance across country, encamped at
Hall. Baptiste had been despatched southward, to
meet the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Excited by promise of flour and rice and dried
meat and butter, the Frémont camp slept little this
night, and early in the morning, which was September
16, started onward. In the afternoon of September 18,
emerging from the hills, with a cheer they greeted the
sight of a green valley set amidst a sombre sage plain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and beside the sparkling Portneuf River which watered
it, the white walls of a trading post. This was the
British Hudson Bay Company post of Fort Hall, on
the Portneuf, a mile above the Snake itself, in the
Plains of the Snake.</p>

<p>Thomas Fitzpatrick, his boyish ruddy face glowing
from its frame of oddly white hair, came to meet them.</p>

<p>“How are supplies?” asked the lieutenant, at once.</p>

<p>“I’ve saved all I could. We’ve been on short
rations. But the post is ’bout as poor as when Kit
left it. Emigrants cleaned it out. Beef and butter is
what you’ll get; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Where are the emigrants? Don’t see any.”</p>

<p>“Gone; wagons, cattle, women, children and all.
Left a few steers and oxen, in trade; but they took
most of their stuff right along.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they can get through, with their
wagons, Fitzpatrick?” queried the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“If anybody but that missionary doctor was leading
them, I would say not,” replied the Broken Hand.
“Why, even the Fort Hall people don’t try to fetch
in their goods on wheels; they canoe it from Vancouver,
for two hundred miles, then they use pack animals for
the land trail, up along the Snake to the post. I agree
with Captain Grant that no wagons can go over that
pack trail. But as I understand, this missionary doctor
came riding in hot haste, from down the Snake,
found the emigrants discouraged by Grant and other
post people, called them together, made a speech, told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
’em he’d been over the trail and he <em>knew</em> and that they
were foolish to abandon their wagons and implements
and try to take their goods and families in by saddle,
that they’d need their States animals to plough with,
and that he guarantee to <em>get ’em through</em>!”</p>

<p>“Will he?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Thomas Fitzpatrick, slowly,
rubbing his chin; “they left, wagons and all, August
thirtieth, and now it’s September eighteenth and none
of ’em has come back; and there aren’t any wagons
lying ’longside the trail, far as we’ve seen.”</p>

<p>Now the two parties united camped beside the walls
of Fort Hall. Agent Grant himself stepped out to
give welcome and meet the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“You Americans are a wonderful people,” declared
Agent Grant. “Why, this emigration that just
went through is four or five times as large as that of
last year, and it’s taking wagons in! Heavy farm
wagons, heaped with goods!”</p>

<p>“Will they succeed?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I and every other man of experience
know that the trail is impossible for wagons. At least——”
and Agent Grant hesitated, “impossible except
perchance for this Doctor Whitman. I never heard or
talked with such an obstinate, determined man. He
has a tremendous responsibility on his hands, though.
I’ll wager that before you get two hundred miles from
the post you’ll find the trail fairly littered with cast-off
wagons. But if not, lieutenant—if <em>not</em>, then it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
be a blow to British rule in Oregon. I have heard Dr.
McLoughlin, our chief agent, at Vancouver, say that
Oregon is safe, because it never can be reached by
Yankee families except around Cape Horn; but what
he’ll say when he sees the Yankees coming down from
the mountains, with wagons, all the way from the
States, I don’t know. And such a number! Last year
Dr. White took in a few, afoot or by saddle and pack—but
this year, eight hundred, with wagons—my
stars! If they get through, then I shall expect to hear
of them continuing right on down to the ocean and
under it to Japan!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed.</p>

<p>“You British in Oregon don’t know the American,”
he said. “When the Yankee once starts for a
new country, nothing can stop him.”</p>

<p>“But some of them didn’t know they were in Oregon
yet!” expostulated Captain Grant. “They asked
me: ‘Say, stranger, how far to Oregon?’”</p>

<p>“They asked us the same, back on the Bear.”</p>

<p>“And still they were pressing on!” gasped Captain
Grant. “Well, well!”</p>

<p>“How are you fixed for supplies?”</p>

<p>“Cleaned out, lieutenant. But I have some Yankee
oxen.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>Agent Grant was a kindly man, helping Americans
and British alike. The emigrants had been supplied
by him with whatever he had that they wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
The lieutenant was enabled to buy of him several
horses, and five fat oxen.</p>

<p>Now indeed winter set in with an all-day snow.
Suddenly the country looked bleak and drear. By
travel up and down to the end of the trail at Vancouver
was some 900 miles. Lieutenant Frémont called his
company together and made a short address.</p>

<p>“I am under instructions to go on to Vancouver,”
he said. “It is not a pleasant nor an easy trail, at the
best, and as winter is at hand there are some of you
whom I will discharge. It is impossible for me to
continue with so large a company, and several men
are in no condition to take the trip, anyway. Those
whom I discharge I discharge with honor; they will
be entitled to transportation and to pay until they
reach the frontier again.”</p>

<p>So he named Charles DeForrest, Henry Lee, John
Campbell, William Creuss, Auguste Vasquez, Alexis
Pera, Patrick White, Baptiste Tesson, Michel Crelis,
and François and Basil Lajeunesse. Everybody hated
to have Basil go, but his family needed him.</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss the German, and Sergeant Zindel the
Prussian artillerist, and Jacob the colored boy, and
the gallant Alexander Godey of the black silky locks,
were retained; and of course Kit Carson and Thomas
Fitzpatrick the White Head; and, hurrah, Oliver!</p>

<p>In the midst of cold rain and gusty wind camp was
broken, and the march was resumed: that of the one
party for the South Pass, 300 miles, and Fort Laramie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and home; that of the other party for the Columbia
River, 600 miles, and Vancouver, and—who knew?</p>

<p>Therefore down along the great and desolate Snake
River travelled the party of Lieutenant Frémont. Ever
the wagon-wheel tracks of the 800 emigrants led on,
and on.</p>

<p>The Frémont company found the road growing
rougher, with many steep grades up which the men
must boost the carts, one by one. Nevertheless, the
heavier emigrant wagons had passed; none had yet
been abandoned.</p>

<p>Thomas Fitzpatrick the Bad Hand again was delegated
to keep the rear, and bring along the baggage-train;
the lieutenant and his lighter column pushed to
the front.</p>

<p>After a week of travel Snake Indians, fishing for
salmon, were passed. Fat and ruddy-faced and jolly
with the oily meat were these Snakes, and to the company
traded salmon fresh and dried. “Haggai, haggai
(fish, fish)!” cried the Indians, glad to see more
white wayfarers; for to the Indians the “Bostons,”
as they called the American settlers, had brought much
prosperity in shape of old trousers and battered hats
and such gear, exchanged for fish.</p>

<p>At the first Ford of the Snake, where the Oregon
Trail crossed from the left or the south bank to the
right or the north bank, the Frémont men almost lost
their howitzer and mules in the strong current. But
the emigrants, said the Indians, had chained their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wagons in a solid line, and had crossed, and had gone
on. The distance from Fort Hall was 250 miles, and
Agent Grant’s prediction of wreck and litter upon the
trail had not come true. The wheel marks continued.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week of travel the Frémont
party reached Fort Boisé, Hudson Bay Company
trading post, companion to Fort Hall, now 350 miles
eastward.</p>

<p>Agent Payette reported that sun-browned and
gaunt and tattered, with wagons creaking and cattle
limping, the Yankee emigrants’ train had passed
through.</p>

<p>“An amazing sight,” affirmed Agent Payette.
“Men, women and children, in they poured and out
they went, piloted by your Doctor Whitman. They
are eleven days ahead of you. They have come thus
far—but worse awaits them, when they leave the Snake
and strike into the hills for the Blue Mountains. That
is a trail scarcely fit for pack-mules, so thick grows the
sage.”</p>

<p>At Boisé the road again crossed the Snake, from
right to left bank, and the faithful rubber boat came
into good play. It, and a portion of a bullock carcass,
were left at the post for the use of the Thomas
Fitzpatrick party, toiling in second division.</p>

<p>On the third day out of Fort Boisé, sure enough the
trail veered from the rushing Snake, and inland pointing
would cross the northeastern corner of present
Oregon State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougher waxed the way. There were signs that
the emigrants had been in much trouble. At one place
a wagon had been overturned twice, in a short
distance.</p>

<p>Straight down a steep rocky slant, as sharply
pitched as a peaked roof, had plunged the emigrants,
their wagon wheels scoring deeply the scant soil. And
down by the same route went the Frémont party, holding
hard on the howitzer and the spring-carriage.</p>

<p>Agent Payette had told the lieutenant of an Indian
trail out which would prove better than that road
which the emigrants probably would take. Following
this to the Blue Mountains, the Frémont party climbed
the heavily wooded divide, where logs must be chopped
and trees must be felled to clear a way for the howitzer
and the carriage. At last, from an open spot across the
summit, westward could be descried the Walla Walla
River, tributary to the Columbia, and light green
patches which must be the settlements of American
missions.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 24 these green patches
were reached. They were the missionary station of
Doctor Whitman himself. Fields had been cultivated
to potatoes and corn; and here, at Waiilatpu, among
the Waiilatpu Indians of the Cayuse nation, on the
Walla Walla River near to present Walla Walla City
in southeastern Washington State, was the Doctor
Whitman house, made with adobe clay bricks.</p>

<p>Oliver had looked forward to seeing again this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
plucky Doctor Whitman, physician, missionary and Oregon
enthusiast—that wayworn traveller with the mixed
white and brown hair, the large mouth and the deep-set
blue eyes, who had arrived, so nearly exhausted,
in Taos last winter on his long trip from coast to coast.
Doctor Whitman was absent down the river to bring
back Mrs. Whitman. But here were many of the emigrants,
resting and staring and eating potatoes.</p>

<p>On the way from Waiilatpu down along the Walla
Walla to the mouth at the Columbia more emigrants
were passed. They all were loud in their praises of
Doctor Whitman.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the Walla Walla was Fort
Walla Walla, a third of the chain of Hudson Bay
Company posts along the trail. A few hundred yards
below flowed past the lordly flood of the noble Columbia
River.</p>

<p>The next supply station in prospect was The Dalles,
150 miles below, where the Methodist missions had
headquarters.</p>

<p>Indians, Cayuse and Nez Percé (Pierced Nose),
were met; some of them seemed almost civilized, in
their white-man clothes, and could speak a little English.
This was the influence of the Protestant and
Roman Catholic missionaries. And again, some of the
Indians met seemed not civilized at all, being very
dirty, and inclined to steal horses. However, they
were not now dealing with weary and ignorant emigrants;
they were dealing with mountain-men—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Kit Carson and Oliver, Lieutenant Frémont and the
German Preuss; so they reaped no horses.</p>

<p>The snowy dome of mighty Mt. Hood uplifted, a
beacon before, marking the high Cascade Range where
winter was in full reign. The air, at night, was cold,
below freezing—but all were accustomed to this; and
worse was to come.</p>

<p>On November 4, forty-three days and 700 miles
from Fort Hall, 102 days and 1925 miles from Fort
St. Vrain, into the mission settlement of The Dalles
of the Lower Columbia rode, with their best bearing
and at their best pace, the tanned, weather-stained,
patched and gaunt but never beaten Frémont and
Carson men.</p>

<small>SOUTHWARD FOR THE UNKNOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Reverend H. K. Perkins was missionary in
charge of the station here at The Dalles. He and Mrs.
Perkins and all their household gave the Frémont
party a hearty American welcome. It seemed good to
be among wooden houses, and ploughed fields, and
gardens; and the lieutenant and the French said that
it reminded them of Missouri.</p>

<p>Fort Vancouver was ninety miles on, down the
Columbia and beyond the Cascade Range. Lieutenant
Frémont decided to leave the party and the animals to
rest at the mission, while he went ahead, by canoe, to
finish his survey by reporting at Vancouver. This
would connect the survey with the survey made along
the coast by Lieutenant Wilkes; and besides, at Fort
Vancouver resided Dr. John McLoughlin, chief of the
Hudson Bay Company in Oregon. To call upon him
was a necessary courtesy from the American Government
to the British Government. Furthermore, at
Vancouver probably could be purchased supplies of a
kind that could not be found at the missionary stations.</p>

<p>The fifth of November being Sunday, of course this
was a day of rest for everybody at The Dalles; but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Monday the Reverend Mr. Perkins helped the lieutenant
to hire a large canoe from the Indians here, and
three Indians, who owned it, were engaged as crew.
With them, and taking Mr. Preuss, Jacob Dodson the
colored youth, and Baptiste Bernier, the lieutenant
launched off for Vancouver.</p>

<p>He appointed Kit Carson in charge of the camp,
and up the back trail he sent a note for Thomas Fitzpatrick,
instructing him to drop the carts at Dr. Whitman’s,
and to come on to The Dalles with pack-saddles.
Kit Carson also was instructed to be making pack-saddles.</p>

<p>All this was very interesting.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll go back by the same trail we
came out, Kit?” queried Oliver.</p>

<p>“Wall, I dunno,” mused Kit Carson. “But I
reckon not. That’s not Frémont way. We found the
trail out hyar already made, an’ nothing left for us
to do but to follow along an’ calkilate figgers. So the
government at Washington’ll know all about the Oregon
Trail an’ about the lake, too; an’ it won’t be like
Frémont to take the back track. He prefers the new
to the old. Once or twice he’s spoken of going back
by the north, around the head o’ the Missouri, an’
down. But these hyar pack-saddles mean a new trail
somewheres.”</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Perkins had suggested to the
lieutenant that he could reach Washington quickest
and easiest by chartering a small brig, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
anchored in the river below Fort Vancouver, and sailing
down the coast to the Isthmus of Panama, there to
cross and charter another vessel for the United States.
Consequently, with this in prospect, and with the return
by way of the sources of the Missouri in prospect,
the future looked bright. Besides——</p>

<p>“Or else,” remarked Kit, “thar’s the southern
trail, to find that Buenaventura River emptying from
the desert into the ocean, and to strike the Spanish
Trail for the mountains an’ the States. The lieutenant
has been mightily interested in the Buenaventura.
He’s talked considerable about it.”</p>

<p>Here was the third route.</p>

<p>The lieutenant returned on the afternoon of the
eighteenth. At once was it known that he had decided
for the southern trail, into the unexplored, where
awaited the fabled Buenaventura.</p>

<p>According to the lieutenant, and to Kit Carson, and
all, this was a country well-nigh unexplored, this country
south, lying between the Wasatch Range of the
Great Salty Lake on the east and the Sierra Nevada
Range bordering California on the west. All accounts
agreed that it was a great basin, of sandy, salty, sagy
bare-rock desert broken by sudden peaks and ridges.
In it Lieutenant Frémont anticipated finding strange
peoples and wild valleys and curious waters.</p>

<p>First to be encountered, upon the march down
from the Columbia of the north, was a lake called
Tlamath or Klamet or Klamath Lake, which in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
spring was a real lake, but which in the summer and the
fall was only a green meadow. This lake was at the
head of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rivière des Chutes</span> or Falls River, which
from it flowed north for the Columbia. From the neighborhood
of the lake the Sacramento River of California
flowed south, and the Tlamath River flowed west to
the ocean. Moreover, the Tlamath Indians, living at
the lake, were said to be treacherous and hard fighting.</p>

<p>Next to be encountered, as the lieutenant hoped,
was a flat desert lake called Mary’s Lake, down in the
Great Basin.</p>

<p>Next should come the fabled Buenaventura, or
Good Fortune River, flowing across from the vicinity
of the Great Salt Lake clear to the Pacific, and emptying
into the Bay of San Francisco!</p>

<p>With the Buenaventura located, as a water-way
from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, then the
Frémont party might head eastward more, for the
Rockies themselves, and the Arkansas River, and
Bent’s Fort below.</p>

<p>Now everybody was enthusiastic. No one objected
to starting out at once, in the beginning of winter,
after hard travel already of 2000 miles, for the unknown.
The talk was of hidden lakes and rivers and
boiling springs, and of marvels of man, beast and
plant such as the Great Salty Lake had failed to
produce.</p>

<p>“Hooray for the new country!” was the cry.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had brought back from Fort Vancouver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
provisions of flour, dried peas and tallow, for
three months. The tallow was to be used in frying,
etc. Enough horses had been engaged from the Indians
about the mission to recruit the number of animals,
saddle and pack, to 104. The Reverend Mr.
Perkins prevailed upon two of his Indians to be guides
as far as the Tlamath Lake. One of these Indians
had fought the Tlamaths there, and had been wounded,
so he was not likely to forget the route. The pack-saddles
were finished rapidly, and other preparations
responded, as fast, to the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first Thomas Fitzpatrick and his
party, including Mr. Talbot the tenderfoot (soon to be
a veteran), Alexander Godey of the handsome hair,
Sergeant Zindel the Prussian artillerist, arrived. When
they had heard, they also were eager for the trip. Mr.
Gilpin must proceed on, to Vancouver; Mr. Dwight
already had gone.</p>

<p>Upon the twenty-fourth all arrangements were
completed. At the last the Reverend Mr. Perkins
brought to the camp a Chinook Indian boy, aged nineteen,
who wished “to see the whites” and learn how
the whites lived in their homes of the east. He had
been in the Perkins household and could speak a little
English. Him the lieutenant enrolled, promising to
return him to his relatives and friends, after the
journey.</p>

<p>This night of November 24 the camp was so excited
over the new trail and the homeward way, that nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
slept well, and all rose before daylight, to breakfast and
pack by the cold star-shine.</p>

<p>Twenty-two or three whites there were—American,
French, German, Canadian—to take the trail for the
Buenaventura: twenty-two or three whites, Jacob the
young negro, the Chinook stripling, 104 horses and
mules, a number of cattle, the howitzer, and Oliver’s
dog from the River of Weeds. The trusty spring
wagon was left behind, as a gift to the mission. Its
glass lamps had been broken, and one of its front panels
had been kicked in by a horse; otherwise it was of good
condition. The mission was pleased to have it.</p>

<p>In a long line, about noon of this November 25
(Thanksgiving season!) of 1843, amidst flurries of
snow, the expedition set forth from the Dalles of the
Columbia. The Reverend Mr. Perkins rode out with
them for a few miles, to wish them God-speed. Finally
he must stop.</p>

<p>“Good-by, good-by, and God bless you,” he said,
beginning with the lieutenant, and shaking hands all
down the line. “Good-by and good fortune.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” they responded; and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir,
monsieur.</span>”</p>

<p>The course was south, up the long valley of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rivière des Chutes,</span> with the white Cascade Mountains
on the right, and many an icy stream to ford.</p>

<p>At the headwaters of the River of the Falls a pine
forest was entered, December 8; a pine forest cloaking
magnificently a yellowish-white soil of pulverized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
pumice-stone whereon grew not a blade of grass. The
Indian guides pointed out, as great curiosities, pine
cones a foot and a half long.</p>

<p>Now the trail was good, the weather pleasant, if
crisp, but the horses and mules and cattle fared badly
for lack of grass. Then, on December 10, from the
pines the cavalcade emerged upon a wide green
meadow—a lake of grass; and—</p>

<p>“Tlamath Lake! Tlamath Lake! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lac du
Tlamath!</span>” welled the glad cheer.</p>

<p>This must be it. Thus the two Indian guides declared
it, and by its meadow character it answered to
descriptions. The horses and mules and cattle eyed
wistfully the green expanse extending to their feet;
and they fell greedily to cropping.</p>

<p>Surrounded by timbered slopes was the lake-meadow.
It looked peaceful. But according to trapper
theories, “Whar thar ain’t any Injuns to be seen,
then thar air the most of ’em!” and here in the
Tlamath country no chances should be taken needlessly.
Moreover, out in the middle of the lake-meadow
smokes were rising, and beyond, along the
shore, were other smokes.</p>

<p>“Better speak to ’em with the big gun, to tell ’em
who we air, hadn’t we, captain?” suggested Kit
Carson.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” seconded Fitzpatrick the
Bad Hand.</p>

<p>“Yes; throw a shell across the lake, sergeant; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
don’t hurt anybody,” said the lieutenant to Sergeant
Zindel.</p>

<p>Nothing loath was Sergeant Zindel. He and his
cannoneers sprang to the brass howitzer, unlimbered
it and swung it about, pointing it diagonally over the
lake-meadow. Under the short guttural orders of the
sergeant a charge was rammed home, and was followed
by a shell. The three Indians—the two guides and
the young Chinook—gazed with much wonderment,
and even the Frémont men were expectant.</p>

<p>The cannoneers sprang aside; Sergeant Zindel
applied the fuse to the primed vent. The loud
“Boom!” of the howitzer rolled to the mountain-slopes
around about, but before any echoes had answered,
there a quarter of a mile away, over the lake-meadow
against the timber back-ground burst with
white explosion the shell!</p>

<p>“Bravo! Hooray!” cheered the company, now
listening to the echoes.</p>

<p>“Wah! The gun that speaks twice!” murmured
the three Indians, awed by the shot.</p>

<p>“Those fellows know something’s happened, all
right,” remarked Mr. Talbot.</p>

<p>For instantly every smoke had been quenched, as
the frightened Tlamaths would conceal their villages
and themselves from the astounding “medicine
people” who had appeared.</p>

<p>Camp was pitched upon a piny point, before which
the animals could graze under guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian guides were of the opinion that the
dreaded Tlamaths were “very little” before the white
men and the gun-that-speaks-twice. Lieutenant Frémont
determined to keep up the first impression made;
therefore, as this afternoon and the next morning no
Tlamaths had come near, he resolved to visit <em>them</em>.
Arrayed for peace or war, out into the lake-meadow
boldly rode the company.</p>

<p>The smoke place was distant and obscure, until
when within half a mile of it a collection of low round
huts could be distinguished, with Indians perched atop,
watching.</p>

<p>“These hyar guides want us to form line, trapper
fashion, an’ ride down in style,” explained Kit Carson.</p>

<p>To humor the guides, who were proud of their
company, the Frémont men ranged themselves in a
long front, and proceeded at a pace, while the guides
galloped ahead to meet two Indians now approaching
from the village.</p>

<p>They were the village chief and his wife; and
they had come out, on behalf of their alarmed people,
to live or die at the mercy of the mysterious strangers.</p>

<p>The Tlamath chief, handsome of face and soft of
voice, thankful that his life was spared, conducted
the powerful strangers to his village. This was composed
of a few large woven-grass huts, entered by
doors in the rounded tops. Grass were the huts; grass
the shoes and the caps of the inmates, and grass were
the mats and baskets of the furnishings. Fish was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the food. Therefore well did the Klamath—whom
Lieutenant Frémont styles Tlamath—call themselves
“People of the Lake,” for by rushes and fish the lake
supplied them with their necessities of life.</p>

<p>Sharp-nosed, prick-eared, woolly, wolfish dogs were
sitting, with their masters and mistresses, upon the
roofs of the huts; and as companion to Oliver’s dog
the men purchased a puppy, whom they named
“Tlamath.”</p>

<p>Now the two guides from the mission at the
Dalles concluded that they had come as far as was
required of them; they would turn homeward. Lieutenant
Frémont asked the Tlamath chief for Tlamath
guides onward; but the handsome, soft-spoken Tlamath
chief shook his head, and by signs indicated that he had
no horses, the snow on the mountains was deep, and his
family were sick. He could not go, and it seemed that
he had none of his young men to send, either.</p>

<p>Therefore, the next morning, the Frémont and Carson
company started out, to make their own trail.
Snow was falling, the sky was dark, and for a mile
and a half they crossed the narrow end of the lake-meadow,
where amidst the frozen grass were ponds of
ice upon which the pack animals slipped and floundered.</p>

<p>The travel was east, pointed for another “large
water” which the Indians said would be found in that
direction, after a few days’ journey. Thus, from the
lake-meadow, which was not really Klamath Lake of
Southern Oregon, but was only Klamath Marsh, north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the lake proper, the company again entered the
great pine forest. Here some of the trees were five
and six feet through, at the base.</p>

<p>That night the thermometer dropped to zero.
Among fallen timber and in snow sometimes a foot
deep the morning march was made, the overworked
mules tugging at the heavy howitzer. Then was heard
the sound of galloping hoofs, behind. Everybody turned,
to welcome or to fight, whichever might be demanded.
It was the good-hearted Tlamath chief and a few other
men, coming on, along the trail, through the myriad
stately, snow-weighted pines, to guide the strangers.</p>

<p>Always amidst pines, and snow, over a broad
mountain eastward led the Indians, until on the next
day they explained that the snow was growing too
deep for them, and the cold too severe, and that they
must turn back. Lieutenant Frémont gave them presents
of scarlet cloth, moccasins, etc.; and spreading
the Flag before them he explained its use.</p>

<p>“This is the symbol of the great nation to which
we belong,” he said, by signs. “Whenever it comes
to you, you must treat it well, for it is friendly to you.
You and it are friends.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Tlamaths nodded wisely. As if in
remembrance, they ever have been at peace with the
white race; although their cousins, the Modocs, badly
treated by the white immigrants, finally fought a
great fight, among their lava beds, in 1873.</p>

<p>The Tlamaths, or Klamaths, left for their snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
grass huts in the lake-meadow. Travelling now by
compass into the unknown, down from the bleak mountain
and across a level valley and up another bleak
mountain, eastward toiled the company. Ever the
course lay through constant, silent pines, where the
snow sifted thickly, with no breeze bearing it, or where,
three feet deep and crusted, it cut the legs of the
animals.</p>

<p>Thus, in long single file of men and of animals,
exhausted and apparently lost, the cattle laboring heavily,
the Frémont expedition to the Buenaventura traversed
the gloomy stretch of high, unceasing, snow-enshrouded
but gloomy forest, where apparently man
had never been before. Suddenly the lieutenant, leading,
spoke to Kit Carson, just behind.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the trees thinning, in front, there, Kit?”</p>

<p>Hope was in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I believe they air, captain.”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” called the lieutenant, cheerily.
“We’re getting out.” And he spurred forward his
horse. Spurred forward all.</p>

<p>Sure enough, ahead the atmosphere was distinctly
lighter. The lieutenant was first to reach the spot;
he reined in his horse, Proveau the buffalo-runner, and
craned as if gazing down. He uttered a loud shout,
and waved his hat; shouted and waved Kit Carson, the
next to arrive. Mr. Preuss the German joined in the
excitement; joined Godey and Jacob and even the
Chinook, and when it came Oliver’s turn he also joined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
For they all were ranged upon a rim of a great wall—a
great wall of sheer rock, piled with snow and bitten
by icy wind, while below, a thousand feet, was an
enchanted summer-land!</p>

<p>Here was a lovely blue lake, in the midst of a
lush green prairie enveloped by warm sunshine; while
up above, on the top of the precipice, reigned snow
and ice and stormy sky. Scarce could they believe their
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t see any trees, to speak of, down there,”
mused Lieutenant Frémont, as shivering they gazed,
admiring the scene. “That looks to me like the Great
Basin, at last. We must be on the edge of it. It
extends on east to the Salt Lake.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t we gwine down to summah, lieutenant?”
queried Jacob the colored youth, anxiously, his teeth
chattering. “I’se stone stiff.”</p>

<p>“So am I, Jacob,” answered the lieutenant, laughing.
“Of course we’re going down. Who’s for
Summer Lake?”</p>

<p>“I’m for getting off this hyar Winter Ridge,” said
Kit Carson.</p>

<p>“That’s it—Summer Lake and Winter Ridge!”
cried the lieutenant. “Three cheers, boys! Good-by
to Winter Ridge, and on to Summer Lake!”</p>

<p>They cheered; and turning the poor horses and
mules and cattle who had dully been nosing the snow
or pricking their ears at the glimpse of green below,
they sought for a trail down.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII</a><br />
<small>SCANT CHRISTMAS COMFORT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Not until after four or five miles of close search
was any descent at all discovered. Down they scrambled,
amidst rock and snow; a pack mule, slipping,
rolled head over heels for 300 feet until stopped by a
ravine; the howitzer must be left midway of the steep
trail, for further effort; and night overtook them before
they reached the bottom.</p>

<p>A real lake, with real grass, it was. By the lake
were several dry cedars, which fed fires to guide in the
rearmost of the struggling company. Finally all were
safe, camp was pitched, supper was cooked, the animals
grazed contentedly. Above, were gloomy pines and
snow and chilling wind of winter; here below, were
limpid water and tender grass and mild breeze, if not
of summer then at least of spring.</p>

<p>Travelling along the west shore of this Summer
Lake in south central Oregon (Klamath Marsh just
to the west of it, and the ridge between), the company
rounded the southern end, and amidst much recent
Indian sign and a bleak country of marsh and sand
and weeds and black volcanic rock crossed eastward to
another large lake. This is Lake Abert, named by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Lieutenant Frémont in honor of his colonel, J. J. Abert,
Chief of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, United
States Army.</p>

<p>Dignified and worthy of the name appeared this
lake, twenty miles in length, and spread between black
ridges; but as they drew near, a shiver passed through
the column, for the shores were drifted high.</p>

<p>“Look at the snow, captain!” cried Kit.</p>

<p>When they drew nearer still they found that they
were barred from the water itself by mud. A sickening
odor filled the air, and the drifts of snow turned out to
be a disgusting, powdery white substance banked high
by evaporating water.</p>

<p>Thus deceptive proved this land into which they
had been lured: a land of fair lakes which changed
to fetid pools; of streams which led on until they
ended only at the unwholesome lakes; of green grass
sour and salt-encrusted; and of bare black ridges which
gave place only to more bare and black ridges.</p>

<p>The Frémont and Carson company pushed on,
the line straggling as the weakening animals fell behind.
Somewhere in this vicinity should be Mary’s
Lake; and beyond should be the Buenaventura, with
rich grassy bottom-lands and much fat game to cheer
the heart of all.</p>

<p>Save for ducks, on the mud-engirded lakes, and
rabbits in the sage-brush, game here was none. Indian
signs, as trails and as deserted huts of brush,
were many. The expedition must advance cautiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>From Lake Abert they moved southward, past another
lake from which they were barred by mud, and
Christmas Eve they camped at the south end of yet
another lake.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t much like Christmas Eve down in Washington
or in old Missouri; is it, Mistuh Frémont?”
commented Jacob the colored youth.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ll enjoy our Christmas all the more,
next time, Jacob,” answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Water an’ grass air better than usual, anyhow,”
vouchsafed Kit Carson. “Might have a wuss camp.”</p>

<p>“’Xpect that’s our Christmas gift,” mused Jacob.</p>

<p>Around the camp fires they all proceeded to review
the Christmas celebrations such as they knew; and
there was quite a variety: Kit and Oliver could tell
of the celebrations by the Mexicans in New Mexico,
the lieutenant and Jacob could tell of those in the
South, Mr. Preuss of those in Germany, the St. Louis
French of those in St. Louis and vicinity, the Canadian
French of those in Canada, Thomas Fitzpatrick recalled
Christmas in trappers’ camp, Mr. Talbot that
at his American home, etc.</p>

<p>Oliver slept late, to be awakened by a great outburst
of rifle and carbine reports mingled with the
“Bang!” of the howitzer. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noël! Noël!</span>” cheered
the French. “Merry Christmas!” joined in the lieutenant.
All wished each other the compliments of the
season, and “Christmas Lake” was the camp place
called. An extra ration of sugar was doled out, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Christmas feast. For this was Christmas Day, 1843,
in the desert basin of south central Oregon.</p>

<p>Southward led the trail, and still southward, for on
the west the snowy mountain range hedged close the
course, and on the east the country was ever desolate
and repulsing. No Indians were seen until, December
28, smokes were suddenly descried rising above the
snowy sage-brush. On at a gallop urged the party,
and came so quickly to two huts, rudely built, open
at the top, that the sage fires were burning in them
and baskets and rabbit skins and grass were scattered
about. Now several almost naked Indians were visible,
upon the near-by ridge, and others were hastily
climbing to them.</p>

<p>“Tabibo-bo! Tabibo-bo!” they shouted—or, in
the Snake language: “White! White!” And they
tried to conceal themselves among the rocks.</p>

<p>For them galloped Kit Carson, fearless, holding up
his hand as token of parley. Just as fearless, Alexander
Godey dashing out caught him, and they continued
together. They made a fine sight, these two
gracefully riding mountain-men—Godey with his
floating locks as spectacular as any Custer of the
yellow locks, Kit Carson, not so handsome but more
steady, and both brave.</p>

<p>The Indian men ran as fleet as deer. Turning
back, Kit Carson rode right upon a woman, with two
little children, hiding behind a sage clump. She
screamed shrilly with terror and shut tight her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
He spoke to her in Snake tongue, and brought her to
the lieutenant, at the huts, where by presents and kind
words she was calmed down.</p>

<p>The men would not come in, but from the women
was it learned that they were Shoshokies, or Poor-Snakes-Who-Walk:
Root-Diggers of the Desert, living
upon roots and rabbits and dressing in scant rabbit-skins—a
wretched people, yet wishing to be let alone.</p>

<p>The first week of January, 1844, had been used
entirely, and still there were no signs of Mary’s Lake,
nor of the Buenaventura River. Since leaving the
Dalles of the Columbia fifteen horses and mules had
fallen by the trail or had been stolen; the feet of the
others were cut and bruised; water and grass constantly
disappointed; the trail was blind; on the one
hand were the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, on the
other hand was the interminable, desolate desert;
pressing southward, seeking the line of least resistance,
marched the Frémont and Carson men.</p>

<p>The company advanced cautiously, feeling a route.
By fresh signs Indians must be hovering about, watching,
but none was seen. Then, on the late afternoon
of January tenth, the lieutenant and Kit came hurrying
into camp, with the news that they had been viewing
a great lake—a real deep-water lake, perhaps
Mary’s Lake!</p>

<p>Like the waves of this reputed sparkling lake,
swept through the camp a wave of joy and of hope.
The lake lay just beyond a little saddle or pass which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
closed the end of the draw wherein had been pitched
the camp. The lieutenant and Kit had climbed a
crest of the high lake-shore, the better to survey; and
there they had sat for some time, feasting their eyes
upon the dark-green water, white-capped and rolling.</p>

<p>“But Mary’s Lake is low and rushy, isn’t it?”
queried Mr. Talbot. “At least, so I understand, from
conversation.”</p>

<p>“So I understand, too,” admitted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled Kit; “we’ll see; but that big lake
yonder doesn’t look to me like the Mary’s is said to
look. And when we come to the Buenaventura we’ll
know it by beaver cuttings in it. These basin streams
have no beaver, ’cept towards their heads in the mountains.
But the Pacific slope air full o’ beaver.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” affirmed Thomas Fitzpatrick.
“When we strike a stream over here with beaver sign
in it, it connects with the sea.”</p>

<p>In the morning the company moved forward at best
pace—which was delayed by the hobbling pack animals
and the one ox who remained. Now somebody—it
was Baptiste Tabeau—struck up a paddle song; and
Godey and the lieutenant and Kit and Fitzpatrick and
all joined in:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gai, gai, avançons nous!</span>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">they sang.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Gay, gay, advance we gay!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And Oliver’s dog and Tlamath, the other Indian dog,
barked wolfishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Up the slope of the pass they strove. On the top
the snow was a foot deep, but below, 2000 feet, filling
a wide space between grim snowy peaks lay indeed the
lake—a mighty mass of dark-green, tossing and tumbling.
And one after another, as they saw, they
cheered.</p>

<p>Camp was made at the foot of the pass, beside a
little stream; as soon as duties were performed, everybody
hastened for the lake. Its shore was rocky, cliff-skirted,
mountain-guarded; and its strips of beach
were cut short by towering walls. The water was
slightly tinged with salt; and some of the granite boulders
of the shore were coated with a limy substance.</p>

<p>Indians had camped here before the white explorers;
and following an Indian trail, the next morning
the company moved on, to the lake. A furious
snow-squall hid the waters, and drove the surf four
and five feet high upon the beaches. The trail, leading
between surf and rock-walls, in places was so narrow
that the howitzer barely could pass.</p>

<p>Pyramid Lake did Lieutenant Frémont name this
great water, because of a curious rock, sharp-tipped,
broad-based, like a pyramid, rising five or six hundred
feet, out in the midst of the water. And Pyramid
Lake is the place, to-day, on the western border of the
State of Nevada. The christening occurred January
14, 1844; and upon the rock-bound shore was sacrificed
the last of the cattle, driven clear from the mission
station at the Dalles of the Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Pyramid Lake certainly did not resemble any
description of any Mary’s Lake. An Indian clad in
hare-skins as in a cloak was persuaded to the camp;
three or four more Indians were met on the trail along
the lake shore; and a chief invited the white men to his
village, in a cottonwood grove at the mouth of a river
emptying into the lake. As the company approached
the village, the chief called in a loud voice, and many
Indians, with bows and arrows, appeared from hiding
in the brush.</p>

<p>Here, at last, was a camp of plenty, for after the
Frémont and Carson company had taken a strong position
in a grassy bottom of a bend of the river, Alexander
Godey uttered a loud shout, and pointed. An
Indian was coming, bearing a fish! And what a fish—pink,
and broad, and more than three feet long!</p>

<p>Eagerly the white men (and Jacob) gathered around
the Indian. He had no difficulty in trading his fish
for a strip of scarlet cloth, and away he trotted to bring
another. Other Indians came hurrying, with fish to
trade; so that speedily the business was brisk. Never
were fish taken to a better market.</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss and the lieutenant pronounced them a
salmon trout, probably of flesh very savory and wholesome.
Soon every man (not omitting Oliver) had his
fish, and was cooking it. Some tried roasting, some
broiling, some frying; the air was full of the rich
fumes. Having exhausted their supply, the Indians
were running to the river, to spear more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the Indians wore ornaments of brass
buttons, as if from the whites. However, as the village
spoke a dialect of the Snake tongue hard to understand,
although Kit Carson and Godey and Thomas
Fitzpatrick did their best with the sign language, little
information was extracted. The next morning the
march was resumed, up this Salmon Trout River.</p>

<small>FORCING THE SNOWY SIERRAS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>No beaver cuttings were found upon any of the
streams. High and cold on the right continued the
long tier of the Sierra Nevada mountains—sometimes
white and shining, sometimes dimmed by fresh storm;
blotched by snow, welted with bare ridges, brushy and
bleak on the left stretched for leagues unknown the
desert of the Great Basin: pent betwixt the two, southward
through the mid-winter pushed the wearied Frémont
and Carson men. Around about, on every hand,
welled into the frosty air the signal smokes of unseen
peoples.</p>

<p>Now on the third day, which was January 18, after
leaving Pyramid Lake, the lieutenant called a council,
of Kit Carson, and Fitzpatrick the Bad Hand, and
the German Preuss, and Mr. Talbot the Washington
young man, Alexander Godey, Baptiste Bernier, and
one or two others.</p>

<p>“I teenk,” said Baptiste Tabeau, “Meester the
Lieutenant, he would try to cross the mountains to
other side, where all is warm. Kit Carson say it very
warm, with much grass an’ horse an’ deer over that
side. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi——</span>” and Baptiste, who always was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the jolliest of the company, shrugged his shoulders,
shiveringly. “I hope we go.”</p>

<p>“That snow look mighty deep, on those big mountains,”
uttered Jacob the colored youth. “But I guess
we gwine to freeze to deff as easy as we gwine to starve
to deff. Marse Lieutenant an’ Mistuh Kit’ll get us
through, though.”</p>

<p>The council broke up; Thomas Fitzpatrick, hastening
to look after the animals, which were in his charge,
made the announcement.</p>

<p>“We cross to the Valley of the Sacramento, boys,”
he informed, passing through.</p>

<p>At the news a cheer rang out. Kit Carson added to
the enthusiasm, that night, around the camp fires of
cottonwood and sage.</p>

<p>“I war in the Valley o’ the Sacramento, summer o’
Twenty-nine, with Ewing Young,” he related. “We’d
crossed the desert from Touse. That war my fust
trapping trip, an’ it war fifteen year an’ more ago;
since then I’ve travelled pretty much over all the West,
hunting the beaver, but I tell you, boys, that thar
country o’ the Californy coast beats all. We entered
from the south, an’ followed down the San Joachin,
to the Sacramento, an’ trapped that a ways; an’ the
beaver an’ the otter an’ the wild hosses an’ the elk an’
the deer an’ the trees an’ the forage war something
wonderful. It snows on the mountains, we heard tell,
but down in the valleys it air green an’ spring-like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
winter; a fat country. Thar’s whar we’re heading,
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” they cheered, again. “No more bad
water and salt grass and starvation trail for us.
Hooray!”</p>

<p>So the expedition turned west, for the towering
white peaks not far.</p>

<p>While they were seeking for a pass (their eyes
still eager to mark the least trace of the Buenaventura),
a strange figure came running down a draw. While
his legs worked steadily, he held up an arm as signal.
He was an old Indian, partially naked. He did not
slacken until, out of breath, he had seized with one
hand the first hand that he could reach, while with
the other he extended a little skin bag, as an offering.</p>

<p>When he was done panting, and had been assured
that he would not be killed, he accepted presents for the
bag of pine seeds; and after a talk in sign language
he was hired by scarlet cloth and beads and brass to act
as guide for two days. He stated that he knew of a
good pass, westward.</p>

<p>The pass was not a pass over the range; it was only
a pass over the first foot-hills. More Indians were
induced by friendly signals to come close. They immediately
held out their little skin sacks of pine seeds.</p>

<p>In council with them the lieutenant asked for
guides, again, over the mountains to the country of the
whites. But the Indians, squatting like rabbits and
murmuring together, refused. Their spokesman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
standing, pointed to the snow, and raised his palm
to his chin, and then raised it above his head, to show
how deep was the snow. He signed that the company
should travel southward more, where there was another
pass over a lower range; and here, in one day’s
journey, lived a people who would guide through the
pass of the great mountains themselves.</p>

<p>For bright cloth and goods the Indians agreed
to supply a guide as far as the people of the first pass.
Supplied with pine seeds oily and well-flavored and
as large as small nuts, the company pressed southward
once more, among the snowy foot-hills of the eastern
base of the giant Sierras.</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss and party came toiling up the trail,
from a secondary camp where they had remained in
charge of the baggage, and reported that the howitzer
was stuck fast. Even Samuel Neal, the blacksmith of
the expedition, admitted that the battered cannon was
beyond rescue. Many times had he repaired its carriage,
during the months; it had been his pet; but now
he could do nothing for it. Sergeant Zindel concurred.</p>

<p>“Ach, a goot gun,” he grunted. “I would not
leave it in battle; but such snow and hills——!”</p>

<p>Therefore, after its 3000 miles of service, from
St. Louis of the State of Missouri to the Salt Lake, and
to the Columbia, and down into the desert, here upon
the upper West Walker River of the Nevada-California
border was left the brass howitzer.</p>

<p>Snow fell heavily, the cold increased; and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
shivering Indians, except the young man guide,
dropped away, to return to their village. Frowning
indeed appeared the stormy mountains, where awaited
the first pass, and the guide himself seemed ready to
desert.</p>

<p>“Kit, you and Godey put him between you,”
directed the lieutenant. “Show him your rifles, so
he’ll understand.”</p>

<p>And trudging afoot, like the majority of the company,
to save the horses, Kit Carson and Alexander
Godey took each a side of the nervous Indian and
patted their rifle-stocks significantly. He rolled his
eyes in mute despair. The snowflakes had coated
his dark skin, for he sillily carried his blue and red
cloth tightly rolled, in a wad, rather than don it and
perhaps soil it. Presently the lieutenant called:</p>

<p>“All right, Kit. Let him go. The trail looks
plain.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” answered Kit; “mout as well. He says
thar’s a hut near whar he’ll stay till after the storm.”
And with a single motion of his arm he bade the guide
be free—whereupon away scudded the glad youth, as
hard as he could run, for shelter.</p>

<p>As had been promised by the Indians behind, into
the camp here at the inner foot of the pass came other
Indians. They thronged, mysteriously as wild animals,
to the fires; they were without fear, and were very
inquisitive. The lieutenant held again a council, to
ask for a guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Kit Carson made the sign-talk for the company;
for the Indians an old man responded. The fires blazed
brightly, illuminating the snow, and the trees, and the
Indians, squatting in a row upon logs or ground, and
the company lying about, rifles handy. It was a wild
scene.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” instructed the lieutenant, to Kit,
“that we have come from very far, almost a twelve-months’
journey to the east, and that we wish only
to get across these mountains, into the country there of
the other whites.”</p>

<p>Thus Kit did. The old man answered more rapidly
even than speech—for a gesture conveyed a whole
sentence.</p>

<p>“He says,” translated Kit, “that we can’t get over,
now. Before snow fell it war six sleeps across to
t’other side, whar whites live; now the snow air over
our heads. He says we must follow this hyar river
down, an’ whar it empties into a lake thar air fish,
an’ people, an’ no snow, an’ we can stay thar till spring.
Reckon he means that same lake we war at—Pyramid
Lake.”</p>

<p>“Tell him that we are strong and our horses are
strong, and that we will break a way through the
snow. Tell him that we will give all this cloth and
those beads and other valuables, for a guide on across
the mountains to the country of the white people there.”</p>

<p>Kit did, evidently; gesturing as rapidly as had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the Indian himself, and pointing to the scarlet and blue
cloth, and the beads, temptingly outspread.</p>

<p>“Tah-ve! Tah-ve!” chorused all the Indians,
shaking their heads. “Snow! Snow!”</p>

<p>The old man plucked from the ground a bunch
of dried grass; he gesticulated, and grunted, and shut
his eyes; and suddenly he left the circle, in a great
hurry.</p>

<p>“He says,” translated Kit, “that if we can break
the snow, in three days we’ll come to whar thar’s grass
about six inches high. He’s been that fur hunting
elk; but beyond that his eyes air shut—he’s seen nothing.
Now he’s gone to get somebody who’s been
further.”</p>

<p>Almost immediately the old man returned with a
young man, and posting him in the circle made a talk
about him. Kit translated.</p>

<p>“Hyar’s a young man who’s been an’ seen the
whites. The old man sw’ars by the sky, an’ by the
ground, that it air the truth. Mebbe we can get this
buck to be guide. I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“Melo, melo,” insisted the old man.</p>

<p>“Melo, melo,” nodded the young man.</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“Melo, melo,” grunted all the squatting semi-circle.</p>

<p>“That must mean ‘friend,’” mused the lieutenant.
“‘Melo’ for friend; ‘tah-ve’ for snow; we know two
words, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he says he’ll go, if we give him enough,”
announced Kit, after a talk with the young man.</p>

<p>“Tell him we’ll give him blankets and scarlet cloth
and beads and moccasins and leggins, and more. He’ll
be rich,” quoth the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The young man seemed satisfied; but to make certain
of him the lieutenant kept him and two others in
the headquarters lodge, that night—with Kit lying
just within, across the doorway. And before they
all went to sleep, <a href="#i_fp232">Kit and the lieutenant showed the
three, by signs, how from the rifles and carbines could
speed a bullet and bore them through and through</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>All the night raged a snow-storm. In the morning
the prospect was not very inviting, but Lieutenant
Frémont made a short address. Lean and bronzed,
hair and beard untrimmed, buckskin suit stained and
patched, he stood slender, erect, undaunted, his voice
sounding with clear emphasis.</p>

<p>“To-day, my men, we rest and make ready,” he
said. “To-morrow we cross. We might as well do it
now, as at any time. It is our best chance. To go
back to the lake, among savages of whom we know
naught, would be folly; to go on southward, seeking
some better passage, would be folly. Here we are;
there are the mountains; just on the other side is the
Valley of the Sacramento. It can’t be more than a
hundred miles. We’ve all heard Kit tell of the beautiful
Valley of the Sacramento, with its rich pastures and
its fat game, where there is no winter. Only that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
hundred miles away is summer, men. Think of it!
Who would stay here, on this side, in winter! My
instruments tell me (and you know they do not lie)
that directly west from us, and less than one hundred
miles—in fact, about seventy—is the settlement of
Captain Sutter: that Swiss-American who went down
into California from Oregon in Thirty-nine, and has
founded a post and a farm in the Valley of the Sacramento.
He’s a Missourian, too, and he’ll be glad
to see us. Why, I’ll wager that from the top of the
divide, yonder, we can see into the very valley. One
strong effort, lads—one more strong effort, and we’ll
be in the midst of plenty. Will you follow the guide?”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” they cheered. “Hooray for the
Sacramento and summer doings!”</p>

<p>“How about it, boy?” asked Kit, pausing as he
passed Oliver. “Do you wish you’d gone back to
Touse with Ike?”</p>

<p>“No,” asserted Oliver, stoutly, as with stiffened
fingers he stitched at his ragged moccasin, to repair it.</p>

<p>“Thar’s the lieutenant. I reckon he wants you a
minute,” continued Kit, rubbing his chin thoughtfully
as he surveyed Oliver.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont beckoned. Oliver went over
to him.</p>

<p>“Boy, we’re about out of meat, except for the
animals which we need to break the trail, and for a
couple of rabbits; and we ought to be strong to make
a good start, in the morning. The men of your mess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ask if they may kill your dog, so that we can eat.
He’s grown fat, I notice, while the rest of us have been
growing thin. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Oliver’s heart swelled into his throat, choking him.</p>

<p>“If—if you think best, sir,” he stammered. “But
there’s that other dog. Mine—mine sleeps with me.
He’s—a—good—dog; an awful good dog.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Oliver,” replied Lieutenant Frémont.
“I know just how you feel. But he may be the means
of saving our lives; he couldn’t die in better cause,
could he? That Tlamath dog is only a pup; we must
save him, to grow. Probably we’ll have to eat him
later. But now——” and hesitating, the lieutenant
with his piercing blue eyes examined Oliver anxiously.
“We wouldn’t ask it if it wasn’t necessary. It will be a
little sacrifice, on your part, for the general good.”</p>

<p>“Well——” faltered Oliver, his voice so weak
that he was ashamed of it. “I remember—you and
Kit told me I might have to eat dog; but I won’t eat
<em>him</em>. I won’t! The rest can.” And quickly turning
away, for fear that he was going to cry, he stumbled
off among the trees.</p>

<p>Soon he heard a shot. That was it. Now his dog
never again would nose his hand, or chase rabbits, or
snuggle upon his feet, at night.</p>

<p>When Oliver sidled back to camp, trying to appear
unconcerned, as befitted a mountain-man, suspicious
pieces of fat meat already were laid out upon the snow
in anticipation of the pot.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX</a><br />
<small>AT THE LAST GASP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Now was it the dawn of a sharp, clear winter morning,
February 2, 1844, in the Frémont and Carson rude
camp of one skin lodge and several tents, on the upper
water of the Carson River, at the Nevada-California
line. Oliver awakened early, under his buffalo-robe
brought from Taos: awakened to the crackle of camp
fire, the stir of stiff figures, and the sight of Jacob the
colored youth hurrying with a tin cup of steaming
coffee for the lieutenant in the skin lodge. Jacob
always tried to do this—to get the coffee there before
the lieutenant his master was dressed. He explained
that such was the custom in the south: the members
of the family had coffee served to them before they
were up.</p>

<p>Oliver awakened to another knowledge. This was
the day when the main range of the Sierras was to be
assaulted. Everywhere the fresh snow lay deep and
trackless; the eastern sky was pink, and about the white
peaks of the Sierras, high and close in the west, the
clouds were breaking into filaments.</p>

<p>Oliver tumbled out of his coverings. At a little
distance the half-frozen horses and mules stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hunched, tails to the breeze, or were pawing for herbage.
Kit Carson was up, Thomas Fitzpatrick was up,
the Indian guide was up. He had not escaped. A
glorious figure he made, as equipped with new moccasins
and leggins, with trousers and a shirt, with blue
and scarlet cloth and a large green blanket over all,
he stood by a fire.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont emerged in haste from the
lodge, and nodded to the Indian—whereupon the Indian
pointed to the vasty white pinnacles of the mountains,
and with a grunt shook his head. The lieutenant
paid no attention to such weak spirit. His voice vivified
the camp, and all was hustle.</p>

<p>“Now for summer doings, boys,” encouraged Kit
Carson, as after breakfast, with packs in place and
every man resolved, the procession wended forth
through the snow.</p>

<p>“Now for the Californy Valley an’ summer doings!”
they answered.</p>

<p>The snow had drifted and speedily grew deeper; so
that ten men, on the strongest horses, were put in the
van to break a trail. Thus work began early. As oft
as the horse of the leader was exhausted, his rider
turned out, for the rear, and the next rider took his
place.</p>

<p>Huts entirely covered by snow, where Indians
lived like field mice, were passed: the only sign of inhabitant
was the single trail from the hole of a door
to the foot of a pine tree, and back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guide says the deepest snow air jest beginning,”
on the third day announced Kit, with the advance, to
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“There’s no use trying to bring the animals on
here, to-night,” declared the lieutenant, snow-covered
and panting. Snow-covered and panting were all.
“Oliver, ride down and tell Fitzpatrick to camp at
those springs where we were last night; it’s more
sheltered. We’ll camp where we are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Oliver.</p>

<p>He met Thomas Fitzpatrick, red-faced, snowy,
working like a Trojan to keep the horses and mules
moving, and delivered the message. He did not stay,
for the camp by the springs in the sheltered basin.
He turned about; maybe the lieutenant and Kit and
Mr. Preuss and Godey and Bernier would need him.</p>

<p>The camp of the advance squad had been made,
without tents, in a group of huge pines. Against the
base of one of the pines a generous fire was blazing;
and when Oliver arrived, tired and cold and glad of the
fire, another old Indian visitor was delivering an
oration.</p>

<p>He spoke loudly, in a sing-song manner; and he
spoke long.</p>

<p>“He says,” announced Kit, “that we an’ our critters
can’t go further, this way. We’ll perish, sure.
We must turn back, an’ he’ll show us a better way.
Rock upon rock—rock upon rock; snow upon snow—snow
upon snow: that’s ahead of us. If we get over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
we can’t get down on t’other side; thar air precipices
whar our hosses’ll slip, an’ off we’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I understood his signs, and most of his
words,” remarked the lieutenant, quietly. “But we’re
white men. We’re not afraid.”</p>

<p>The Chinook lad from the mission, who had kept
close by the lieutenant, had understood the signs and
words even better than had Kit Carson; and now
he began to wail aloud.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see the whites,” he lamented, brokenly.
“I came away from my own people to see the
whites. I would not mind dying among the whites,
but to die here—ow-ow-ow-ow,” and shuddering he
drew his blanket over his head. From underneath it
his wail resumed, muffled and weird.</p>

<p>“You ought to have stayed down below, in the
Fitz camp,” reminded Kit, of Oliver. “It’ll be a cold
night, hyar, I tell you.”</p>

<p>And it was. The lieutenant said that the thermometer
was ten above; but a wind set in, sifting
through the tree trunks, blowing aside the heat, and
penetrating blankets and buckskins. The trees
creaked and sighed; the Chinook wailed; more biting
waxed the air; and nobody slept much.</p>

<p>When Oliver turned out early, to do his share in
looking after the shrunken horses and mules, the Indian
guide was pressing to the fire, to be warmer;
under all his unaccustomed clothing of shirt and
trousers and red and blue cloth and green blanket he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was shivering violently. Chancing to glance back,
Oliver saw Lieutenant Frémont throw his own army
blanket over the Indian’s shoulders already once
blanketed; and when Oliver returned, within fifteen
or twenty minutes, from the horses, he found the
camp much indignant. The Indian guide had disappeared,
blankets and all!</p>

<p>The day was spent in bringing up the animals, and
in making snow-shoes and sledges. The next morning
the lieutenant, with Thomas Fitzpatrick and Kit and
others, snow-shoed ahead, to reconnoitre along the
pass which the guide had pointed out before he had
deserted. They came back, in the darkness, scarcely
able to drag their feet, but they brought good news.
They had looked over into a large valley, distant but
snowless. Kit had recognized the valley as the Valley
of the Sacramento.</p>

<p>“I know it!” he declaimed, still much delighted.
“I know it by a little round mountain. Fifteen years
ago I marked that little mountain, when I war in the
valley; an’ I remember it jest as plain as if it war only
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“How far? How far?” demanded all, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Thirty miles, isn’t it, Kit?” answered the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I should say that—an’ more,” mused Kit,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“So should I,” agreed Fitzpatrick. “We aren’t
there, yet, boys; over the ridge and down means some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
long marches, through the snow. The snow’s likely to
be heavier, on the west side. But now we know where
we’re travelling.”</p>

<p>“From the ridge we could make out, through the
glass, prairies and the line of a river bordered with
timber,” explained the lieutenant. “But as Fitz says,
there are some hard marches ahead.”</p>

<p>So there were. By sledges and snow-shoes the
trail was resumed, every heart aglow with pictures of
the Valley of the Sacramento; but on the level the snow
was five feet deep, and in drifts was twenty feet deep.
The animals failed, and must be left at each pasture,
while with wooden mauls and shovels the men flattened
a road, and with pine boughs paved it.</p>

<p>The puppy Tlamath must be added to the larder,
so that for the advance there was a strange dinner,
one night, of dog (cooked by Alexander Godey Indian-fashion,
in pieces hide on), mule, and dried-pea soup!</p>

<p>Now was it the close of two weeks since from the
preparatory camp had the start been made. The crest
of the pass had just been reached, for on February 16,
returning from a scout ahead, the lieutenant and Jacob
reported that they had come upon a creek flowing west,
toward the Pacific!</p>

<p>As they descended, seeking to travel while yet the
night’s crust was unmelted, more plentiful waxed the
snow, more difficult the trail, intersected by drifts and
ridges. However, the lieutenant was convinced that
the little stream discovered by himself and Jacob was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the river upon which, lower, would be found the ranch
of Captain Sutter the Swiss-American settler. The
welcome sound of a thunder-storm in the valley, distant,
drifted up to the company’s rejoicing ears; and
when the storm had cleared, the sunset revealed a
shining spot, as if denoting a bay, and a shining line,
as if of a river, connecting with it.</p>

<p>The Valley of the Sacramento, and the Bay of San
Francisco!</p>

<p>That night, to the yearning, keen-eyed wanderers
so high above this spring-land, appeared in the valley
numerous fires, as if in answer to the fires of the camp.
Thereafter, by day and by night these fires were visible;
but the Frémont and Carson men learned, later,
that they were simply the fires of Indians in the
swamps of the bay shore.</p>

<p>Ice and snow continued. Moccasin soles froze with
slush, they would not cling to the snow or the smooth
rocks, and their wearers must crawl. Once the lieutenant,
reconnoitring with Kit, slipped into the stream,
now almost a river, and without hesitating an instant
Kit plunged into the icy water after him. The lieutenant
thought that he had lost his gun, in the fall; but it
was found, after they had made a fire, under the bank.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the trail was perceptibly lower. The
stream had swelled to a torrent; the ground was soft;
green grass, birds, and oaks appeared, and a mild
breeze swirled the dry oak leaves covering the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
This was glorious; but the worn-out animals were
being killed, for food.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frémont announced that they had descended
from an elevation of 9338 feet to one of 3864
feet. He said that in the morning he and a squad
would push on, by forced marches, for the ranch of
Captain Sutter which could not be very far; and that,
having obtained provisions, they would hasten back
to meet the main party.</p>

<p>“Preuss, Talbot, Jacob, Kit, Derosier, Townes,
Proue,” named the lieutenant, calling off the detail;
and Oliver settled down, disappointed, for he had
hoped to go.</p>

<p>He made no remark, and tried to appear unconcerned;
but the lieutenant must have read his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Is the boy strong enough? We should take only
the strongest men and the best of the horses,” spoke
the officer, aside, to Kit.</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled Kit, reflectively, eyeing Oliver,
“you know it’s pretty hard to tucker out a boy. He’ll
stand more’n a man.”</p>

<p>“And Oliver,” detailed the lieutenant, as if concluding
his list.</p>

<p>Oliver grinned, with cracked lips but glad heart.</p>

<p>The morning was that of February 25. The first
ride was one of twelve miles, down the river valley to
some old Indian huts. Here, by a field of juicy grass,
camp was located; the animals were turned out, and
from that moment until daybreak they never ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
their steady grazing. Throughout the afternoon and
the night could be heard the constant champing of their
jaws. The lieutenant seemed to take much pleasure
in sitting, as long as daylight lasted, and watching
them eat.</p>

<p>The next camp was different. Rain forced the
march from the river trail to the higher ground, until
nightfall; and then camp was made without good
grass—which, combined with the rain, appeared to
plunge the poor animals into the depths of gloom.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” declared Kit. “This won’t do,
captain. These critters air jest on the narrow edge
’twixt life an’ death, an’ they’ve got to have forage an’
rest every night, to carry ’em through the next day.
It’s dangerous, missing grass.”</p>

<p>That was true. Now Proveau the buffalo-runner
could not keep up, and dropped behind. Jacob was
left by the lieutenant to bring him along slowly, while
the squad went on, seeking a camping place. Lunch
was a boiled mule-head. It furnished a soup.</p>

<p>Jacob arrived without Proveau; but he brought
Charles Townes, who worn down by the long privations
was becoming crazed. Just at nightfall, when
all were well-nigh despairing for the lives of the few
horses and mules remaining, the inspiring call of Kit
Carson, on before, in the dark ravine, echoed back.</p>

<p>“This way!” he cried. And as they drove the
staggering animals for him: “Life yet! Life yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
boys! Here’s a hill-side sprinkled with grass enough
for the night!”</p>

<p>Hurrah for Kit—tireless, hard-working, never-say-die
Kit!</p>

<p>Proveau the buffalo-runner, Charles Townes’ fine
young horse from the Columbia River supply, and another
Indian horse packed with the cooking utensils
failed to join the herd; so that the next day some of
the men were sent back after them or any others that
had strayed. Baptiste Derosier appointed himself to
bring in Proveau.</p>

<p>Oliver remained at camp, in the gorge, to guard
the herd. The lieutenant and Kit Carson climbed as
high as they could, for a view; and reported that
beyond the timber the valley seemed to be as far as
ever!</p>

<p>Baptiste and Proveau did not get in, that night;
and Baptiste did not overtake the march, the day following.
It was feared that he had become lost.
Charles Townes was still crazy, and insisted upon
swimming in the icy river; he imagined that this was
summer-time. At evening Baptiste trudged weakly in.
He sat down by the camp fire and began to tell of several
days’ wanderings—as if he had been gone a long
while.</p>

<p>The country was improving, with much grass, and
flowers and butterflies, and acorns to eat; and Mr.
Preuss walked on ahead of the squad, to sketch the
route. That night he did not return to camp. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
next day they found his trail, and they shouted and
fired guns; but the only response they received was
from an Indian, who in the mutual astonishment ran
away.</p>

<p>The march must be continued; but although search
right and left and on the back trail was made for
Mr. Preuss, no sign of him was discovered. The lieutenant
and Kit grew worried; Mr. Preuss had been
unarmed, and no one could tell what the Indians might
have done to him.</p>

<p>Not until the evening of the third day did Mr.
Preuss turn up. While in a beautiful camp among
live-oaks of the river valley they all heard a faint shout
from the hills behind—and Kit, sharp-eyed, cried,
instantly:</p>

<p>“There he is! I see him!”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Preuss, with wavering strides descending
for the camp. They had little to offer him, except
some roasted acorns bought from Indians. He, on
his part, had a story to tell. He had eaten roots, and
ants, and raw little frogs, and had tried to smoke
live-oak leaves; and one night, in the timber, he had
sought out two wolves, thinking that they were Indian
dogs. At last he had met several Indians, who seemed
afraid of him but had given him roasted acorns. Soon
after, he had struck the trail of the squad, and now
here he was.</p>

<p>All this time the march of the squad had been following
down the course of the south or main fork of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the American River of Northern California, as it
rushes from the high western slope of the Sierras for
the Sacramento. Almost at the spot where Mr. Preuss
rejoined his anxious comrades was discovered, in scant
four years, or on January 24, 1848, the placer gold
of California, and quickly as spread the tidings down
poured, from the Sierras, by the Frémont and Carson
trail, the eager Forty-niners.</p>

<p>Mr. Preuss had rejoined the squad on March 5.
Only about half the necessary saddle animals were left,
but these were strong enough, now, to carry riders;
and four and five at a time the squad rode, each division
for an hour. Deer were seen, near at hand; the
order was, not to pause for them, or for anything, but
to press on, press on, for Sutter’s ranch, and rescue.</p>

<p>Gold was plentiful, but it was the gold of the
California poppy covering the sward. The land was
gay with flowers, and dignified with stately oaks.
Tracks of horses and cattle were followed, to an Indian
village, some of whose inmates wore cloth shirts;
yet no information was gained. Next, was expectantly
visited an adobe house with glass windows. Only
Indians, apparently ignorant, inhabited it. Next, in a
broad and grassy valley through which swept gently
the noble river, was entered a larger Indian village.
Its people were clean and wore cotton shirts and other
factory clothing. One of the villagers spoke a little
poor Spanish; but he said that there were no whites
in that country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the lieutenant, while the
hearts of the squad sank.</p>

<p>At this moment came riding another Indian, wearing
a broad-brimmed, peaked straw hat; a ragged
blanket through a slit in which his head had been
thrust; light-blue cotton trousers; and upon his bare
heels tremendous, jingling spurs. He sat in a cumbersome,
high-pommelled, high-cantled saddle, with huge
block stirrups hollowed out of solid wood. Upon
his arm dangled a rawhide riata, or lasso.</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">A su disposición, señors,</span>” he greeted, in common
Spanish. “At your service, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Is this the Sacramento River?” asked Lieutenant
Frémont, in the Spanish.</p>

<p>“No, señor. It is the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rio de los Americanos</span>—the
River of the Americans. It joins the Sacramento
about ten miles below.”</p>

<p>“River of the Americans”! That sounded good;
for to American travellers in foreign land the word
“American” is sweet.</p>

<p>“Where, then, is the ranch of Captain Sutter?”</p>

<p>“Yonder, señor. I am a <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vaquero</span> (cowboy) in
the employ of Captain Sutter. The people of this village
work for him. His house is just over the hill.
If you will wait but a moment, señors, I myself will
guide you thither. He is a very rich man, and he is
always glad to see Americans.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">XX</a><br />
<small>DOWN THROUGH CALIFORNIA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vaquero,</span> or cowboy, had spoken truly. Beyond
the hill was disclosed to view a large trading
post—larger than either Bent’s Fort or Fort Laramie;
built of adobe, like them, and like them fashioned
with blockhouse corners, it had location more attractive,
for it stood amidst wheat-fields and natural verdure,
beside the sparkling American River.</p>

<p>“El Capitan Sutter comes, señors,” announced the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vaquero,</span> pointing.</p>

<p>A man had galloped from the post and its fringe
of out-buildings, and was rapidly approaching the
squad. A short, stout, German-featured man he was,
when he arrived: with rosy complexion, blue eyes,
crisp moustache, high forehead, bald pate, and a soldiery
way about him.</p>

<p>“Welcome, gentlemen,” he said, saluting. “Welcome
to New Helvetia. I am Captain Sutter.”</p>

<p>“I am Lieutenant John C. Frémont, of the United
States Army, on a government survey of Oregon and
the Great Basin,” explained the lieutenant, shaking
hands. “We’ve been forced across the mountains.
I’ve left most of the company behind, while with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
squad I rode in advance, for supplies. Can we get
them?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly. All you want,” answered Captain
Sutter, promptly. “Come with me.”</p>

<p>It was late to start back, to-day, with rescue for the
Fitzpatrick party; but much refreshed by the abundant
food and the night’s lodging at the hospitable post of
New Helvetia they took the back trail, early in the
morning, with horses and provisions. On the second
day out, just before reaching the Forks of the American,
they sighted the Fitzpatrick party straggling
along—and a sorry party that was. All the men were
afoot, tottering as they led tottering horse or mule.
Oliver thought that he never had seen such skeletons
living; and then it occurred to him that no doubt his
own party were just about as bad, and that he was
accustomed to them.</p>

<p>The Fitzpatrick party were too weak to cheer; they
almost were too weak to eat; but the gaunt wan faces
essayed a smile, and one or two hands were languidly
waved. Camp was at once made, and the good rich
beef and bread and salmon from Sutter’s Fort were
distributed—cautiously, that the greedy Fitzpatrick
men should not over-eat.</p>

<p>Thomas Fitzpatrick, his ruddy face drawn and
gray with exhaustion, his white hair ragged, related
that because of the melting snows and the rains a
number of the pack animals had fallen from slippery
precipices and had been killed, their packs lost. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
told, out of the 104 horses and mules with which the
expedition had left the Dalles of the Columbia only
thirty-three arrived in the Valley of the Sacramento;
thus reckoned up Lieutenant Frémont, when, on the
next day, camp of the whole company was established
where the American emptied into the Sacramento, two
miles below New Helvetia.</p>

<p>This New Switzerland, or New Helvetia, as Captain
Sutter had named his settlement, and which was
known also as Sutter’s Fort, was a most interesting
place. The post walls were eighteen feet high, enclosing
a rectangle 150 by 500 feet; they mounted twelve
cannon and were garrisoned by forty Indians whom
Captain Sutter (who had been a soldier in France)
had uniformed and drilled. Lieutenant Frémont did
not think much of the condition of the cannon, nor
very highly of the smartness of the Indian soldiery;
but all in all, the fort was rather imposing, here in
the depth of California.</p>

<p>The jovial captain lived like a Highland chief.
Kit Carson called him a king. Nobody interfered with
him; he had been pronounced a Mexican citizen, by
the governor of Alta California—but, anyway, citizen
or not, he was too strong to be driven out. Besides
the forty California Indians he employed thirty white
men—mechanics, trappers, farmers, etc.; and all the
American trappers and settlers in this part of California
were free to make his settlement headquarters.
His land extended over thirty-three square miles; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
was being grazed and farmed; he possessed 4200
cattle, 2000 horses, 1900 sheep, and sent out many
beaver-skins and much wheat. His house, inside the
fort, was furnished with regular chairs and beds and
tables, of heavy, clumsy manufacture, having been
hand-made, from laurel, at the former Russian trading
post of Ross, on the sea-shore westward. He
sent vessels down the Sacramento and up to Vancouver.
He operated a flour-mill and was teaching
the Indians to weave hats and blankets and to farm.
Yes, powerful and rich and independent was Captain
Johann Augustus Sutter, of New Helvetia, above the
mouth of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rio de los Americanos,</span> Upper California.
’Twas at his saw-mill, fifty miles above his
fort, that was discovered, in the winter of 1848–49,
gold; and speedily his New Helvetia became Sacramento
City.</p>

<p>The two weeks’ camp of the Frémont and Carson
company, at the mouth of the American, was by no
means an idle camp, devoted to sight-seeing or sitting
in the Captain Sutter laurel chairs. Horses and mules
and cattle were to be inspected and bought; new pack-saddles
to be put together; bridles repaired, saddles
repaired, ropes repaired or purchased, clothing repaired
or purchased; Samuel Neal the blacksmith
worked constantly at the post forge, shaping horse-shoes,
bridle-bits, nails, etc.; and the Sutter flour-mill,
grinding by horse-power, was in motion night and
day producing flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>A short council at which Captain Sutter was present
determined upon the route home.</p>

<p>“It would be folly to recross the Sierras, here,”
stated the lieutenant. “I suppose the snow lies on
them away into the summer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” assured the captain.</p>

<p>“I was thinking, then,” continued the lieutenant,
“of travelling south, down the Valley of the Sacramento
and up the Valley of the San Joachin, that Kit
has talked so much about, for the Joe Walker Pass
at the lower end of the ranges. And then to strike
the Spanish Trail that runs from the Pueblo of Los
Angeles to Santa Fé.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” approved the captain. “It’s a fine,
well-watered country, with plenty of game, all the way
to the southern passes.”</p>

<p>“We’re not liable to be interfered with, by the
authorities, are we?” queried the lieutenant. “This
is Mexican territory, and we came in without leave.”</p>

<p>“Not so far back from the coast,” answered Captain
Sutter. “But you’ll have to watch sharp, or the
Indians, particularly the mansitos, or tamed Indians,
as we call the Indians educated by the missions, who
have returned to wild life, will steal your animals.
They are very bold and clever. They even come down
and try to steal our horses at New Helvetia.”</p>

<p>“We’ll watch,” promised the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“No white settlements, captain?” asked Kit.</p>

<p>“None inland, any more than when you travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
through fifteen years ago, sir,” said Captain Sutter.
“The whole country back from the line of missions,
and the few settlements, along the coast, is a paradise
unused except as the haunt of the Indians. It is a fair
land going to waste. Some Anglo-Saxon race should
have it, and cultivate it. That race will be either
England or America; mark my words.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope, America,” responded the lieutenant.</p>

<p>So fair was this sunny California that Samuel Neal
the blacksmith and four others in the company asked
to be discharged, that they might remain. The lieutenant
let them go; and Samuel entered the employ
of the post, at two dollars and a half a day, with
promise of advance.</p>

<p>“Anybody seen Derosier?” demanded Mr. Preuss,
through the camp, on the day before departure. Already
had the camp been moved, in preliminary start,
up stream a short distance, to the ranch of Mr. Sinclair,
former mountain-man, now a farmer.</p>

<p>Nobody had.</p>

<p>“He’s been gone for three days. Does anybody
<em>know</em> anything about him?”</p>

<p>Nobody did.</p>

<p>And Baptiste Derosier, who had been acting oddly
ever since that day, back on the trail, when he had been
lost, never was seen again, nor even heard of. It was
thought that he must have been drowned, or else had
been waylaid by Indians, among the hills. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
company were sorry, for Baptiste was a willing worker
and a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon camarade</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leve! Leve!</span>” at dawn of March 24 resounded
through the camp the regulation trapper call to arise.
To-day was the start to be made in earnest.</p>

<p>With more horses and mules than ever, to the number
of 130; with twenty-five beef cattle and five milk
cows; with plenty of flour and coffee and sugar; well-stocked
the expedition might proceed upon their way.
With them went an Indian boy, assigned by Captain
Sutter to be herder of the cavvy, for the horses and
cattle were almost as wild as buffalo. It would take
an experienced Californian to drive them.</p>

<p>Captain Sutter himself, and several other whites
from the fort escorted the company a few miles, to
say good-by and “good luck.”</p>

<p>Eleven hundred and forty-two miles from the
Dalles of the Columbia or 3000 miles from Fort St.
Vrain had stretched the Frémont and Carson trail
to New Helvetia. Now from New Helvetia to Bent’s
Fort would be 3000 miles more. However, nobody
shrank from the trail as planned. All were strong
again in body as they had been strong in heart, and
their ample pack-train gave them comfort. Nevertheless,
for the first 2500 miles of their journey they could
expect to find no settlement of any kind save Indian
village.</p>

<p>The lieutenant rode a splendid iron-gray Californian
horse, named Sacramento, a gift from Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Sutter. The march was down the east side of the
Valley of the Sacramento, back somewhat from the
river; thence on into the Valley of the San Joachin,
which was companion valley reaching up from the
south, to meet the Valley of the Sacramento extending
down from the north. The country was all that it had
been pictured by Kit Carson, and promised by the lieutenant:
a country of brilliant flowers, blue and yellow
and white and purple, in great masses; of abundant verdure
and water; of great herds of elk, deer, wild horses
and cattle. And as Captain Sutter had declared, it was
a country unused.</p>

<p>As they rode, the lieutenant and Kit waxed more
and more enthusiastic, and Oliver heard them say that
here was where they hoped some day to live.</p>

<p>Mindful of the cautions as to the horse-stealing
Indians, the march was made strictly military. Scouts
were placed ahead, and on the flanks, to beat the brush;
rifle-men formed van, and rear, and between van and
rear were the cavvy, pack-animals and cattle. However,
no Indians were sighted until, on April 8, 280
miles from New Helvetia, at the banks of the Tulare
River natives appeared.</p>

<p>As soon as these ascertained that the Frémont and
Carson men were not California soldiery, they gathered
in friendly fashion, and brought otter-skins, and fish,
and bread and acorn-flour. They were dark-skinned,
handsome Indians. Several spoke Spanish, learned at
the missions. They were well-mannered—but the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and Kit thought best, on the whole, to corral
the animals, at night.</p>

<p>It was time that the pass should be near, on the
left; the pass through the mountain range, to the desert.
A fine broad trail pointed off to the southeast; and upon
being questioned as to a pass in that direction one of
the Indians nodded, with a smile showing white teeth,
and with a “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, señor; buen camino</span> (Yes, sir; good
road).” Following this trail, on for the desert rode
the Frémont and Carson company.</p>

<p>The landscape was growing sandy and more bare.
Diverging to the left, to ascend along a creek, the company
entered, not Walker Pass, but that Tehachepi
Pass through which to-day penetrates from desert California
into valley California the Santa Fé Railroad,
overland line.</p>

<p>While encamped at the western side of the Tehachepi
Pass the camp received another visitor. Down
the pleasantly wooded slope he came riding, with many
a jingle and much graceful sway of body—a combination
of knight-errant and cowboy; and a romantic
sight he made. He wore a large, peaked hat; short
braided jacket reaching scarcely to his waist; black velvet
trousers tight at the hips, flaring at the bottoms,
and slashed along the seams with white; a sash of
crimson; yellow goat-skin boots armed with the huge
Spanish spurs. Bridle and saddle were lavishly decorated;
chains dangled from the one, brass tacks glistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in the other. But he was no Spaniard or Mexican; he
was an Indian.</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buenas noches, señors,</span>” he greeted, cordially, in
excellent Spanish. “Good evening. I saw you enter
the pass, and I have come down to bid you have no
fear.”</p>

<p>“To whom do we speak?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“To a Christian Indian, señor. I am from the mission
San Fernando, near to the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pueblo de Nuestra
Señora la Reina de los Angeles</span> (the Town of Our
Lady the Queen of the Angels),” he explained. “I
have been, by permission of the fathers, to visit my
relatives in the Sierras, beyond here. Looking back,
I saw you.”</p>

<p>“We are much obliged, señor,” answered the lieutenant,
gravely. “Alight and sit. You are acquainted
with the country?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“We are on our way east, to the American States.
What lies across this range?”</p>

<p>“An arid, burning desert, señor; impossible for
man or beast.”</p>

<p>“I remember it,” quoth Kit Carson, nodding. “I
war across it with Ewing Young.”</p>

<p>“Lower down, señor,” corrected the Indian,
politely. “By the Spanish Trail.”</p>

<p>“That war ’fore the Spanish Trail had been broken
through; but it mout have been lower down, o’ course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we cannot cross directly eastward?” queried
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“No, señor. Even the Indians cannot. It is the
Mohave Desert. But if you desire to travel east, after
crossing this pass you should follow south along the
foot of the mountains, where is water and grass, to
the Spanish Trail to Santa Fé. By this route have just
returned six Indians of a great river of the desert, who
have been here trading with my people. For two days
on my way to San Fernando I am travelling the same
road, myself, and I will gladly be your guide.”</p>

<p>They thanked him, and accepted his offer.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a><br />
<small>THE VENGEANCE OF KIT CARSON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Christian Indian of the San Fernando mission
rejoined the march, the next morning; amidst gooseberries,
humming-birds, and yellow flowers, looked
down upon by snow-caps, the pass was threaded; and a
very different crossing of the Sierra Range was this,
from that experienced but a few weeks back!</p>

<p>Unexpectedly to all the company, as the trail wound
down among the foot-hills on the eastern side of the
range the desert unfolded to view. There it lay, waiting,
like a flat, prone dragon. There it lay, as the guide
had asserted: arid, burning, white-hot, with occasional
blackish ridges breaking its surface like scales, and
with its fevered breath, like a mist, quivering above.</p>

<p>“The great <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">llanos</span>—plains,” announced the guide,
dramatically waving his hand. “They have no water,
they have no grass; every animal that goes upon them
dies.”</p>

<p>“The Mohave Desert, I reckon it air,” said Kit
Carson, meditatively surveying. “I crossed it twice,
on that Californy trip, but the trail we made war lower
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the Mohave River, señor, perhaps,” suggested
the guide.</p>

<p>“Guess so.”</p>

<p>“That is lower to the south. The Spanish Trail
which your company will take follows along it.”</p>

<p>On April 17, three weeks from New Helvetia,
among the ridges by which the mountains tapered to
the desert was encountered a little trail cutting east
and west across the southward march. Scarcely could
it be traced, so faint and rarely trodden was it; but the
guide at once turned east, upon it.</p>

<p>“It is the trail between the Spanish Trail, east, and
the mission San Buenaventura, next to Santa Barbara,
on the coast,” he said.</p>

<p>He rode a few miles, and halted.</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios,</span>” he spoke. And indicating the thread-like
trail: “This is the road. It does not lose itself;
it continues on. Follow it, and you will reach the
Spanish Trail ahead of the great spring caravan out
of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pueblo de los Angeles</span> for Santa Fé of New
Mexico; so you will find the grass uneaten. By that
black hill yonder is water. Now I must turn off for
San Fernando.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant and Kit and Mr. Preuss and Mr.
Talbot and others in the van shook hands with him,
thanking him again; and the lieutenant further rewarded
him with presents of knives and bright cloth.
Amidst mutual “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</span> (a Dios—God with you),” he
left, galloping away for the mission <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Fernando</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rey de España</span> (Saint Ferdinand King of Spain),
north of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pueblo de los Angeles</span> which is to-day the
City Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Through draws blazing with flowers purple, lemon
and orange, and richly perfumed, the Frémont and
Carson company followed the little trail eastward until
at the dark ridge out upon a sandy plain they camped
with water but no grass.</p>

<p>For two days and a half the little trail led eastward.
Then, on the afternoon of the third day, April 20, the
advance scouts shouted and waved and waited. When
Oliver, with the van, arrived at the spot, he also joined
in the shout, although not wholly knowing why—save
that here the little trail united with a broad, well-defined
trail, north and south.</p>

<p>“The Spanish Trail from Californy to Santy Fee,
captain,” announced Kit Carson.</p>

<p>“It must be,” agreed the lieutenant. “And it takes
us north, boys! Now we can cross the mountains by
way of the Great Salt Lake and the Utah Lake, to
strike the head of the Arkansas. We’re not to be
cheated out of the fine country.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” they cheered.</p>

<p>“It’s good-by to Californy,” remarked Kit, to the
lieutenant, as now the cavalcade turned into this broad
trail.</p>

<p>“We’ll come again, Kit,” asserted Lieutenant
Frémont.</p>

<p>And they did; to win the fair land for the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
States, and the lieutenant to make here his home, as he
had hoped.</p>

<p>So this was the famous Old Spanish Trail, was it;
this bare road of rocky sand scarred by many hoofs,
stretching on indefinitely athwart the rolling, sparsely
verdured plains?</p>

<p>“You might think it’s called the Spanish Trail
’cause the names on it air all Spanish,” narrated Kit
Carson, as with Oliver he ambled in the dust. “But
like as not it’s called so ’cause the old Spanish Fathers
started it, at t’other end, in their missionary trips out
o’ Santy Fee. They never cut it through, though.
An American did that. I knew his family in Missouri.
He war a trader, ’twixt Missouri an’ New Mexico. His
name war William Wolfskill; an’ in fall o’ Eighteen-thirty
he tuk a trading caravan out o’ Santy Fee for Los
Angeles, an’ he made this trail to try north o’ the Heely
(Gila) River trail. He thought he’d find better grass.
It’s regular caravan trail, for hosses an’ mules to Santy
Fee, an’ calico an’ blankets an’ stuff back ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me that some of these tracks in the trail
are fresh,” commented the lieutenant, riding up.</p>

<p>“So I war thinking,” replied Kit. “Fresh hoof-tracks,
an’ some fresh Injun tracks. Thar must be a
caravan party on ahead o’ the main travel; an’ those
Injun tracks likely air the six fellows spoken of by
that mansito. But in sech a wind, blowing the sand,
sign air hard to read.”</p>

<p>An unpleasant gale was raging—a furious, constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
blast as the cooler air of the mountains on the west
rushed down to fill the vacuum caused by the rising hot
air of the desert on the east. The Spanish Trail continued,
well marked, but with its sharp rocks speedily
setting the animals to limping. It was a trail rougher
than any part of the Oregon Trail. Oliver heard the
lieutenant regretting that the cavvy had not been shod.</p>

<p>The trail had been skirting a river, curious but
refreshing as it flowed briskly and sparkling between
low banks of the whitish sand. A few cottonwoods
and willows grew along it. Oliver observed that
although they were descending it, it was getting smaller
instead of larger—an odd circumstance.</p>

<p>“It’s the Mohave, I reckon,” stated Kit. “At least,
when I came out with Ewing Young we followed up a
river ’bout like this, hyar, on our way from the Colorado
to the Californy missions. You watch it, an’
you’ll see something.”</p>

<p>The next morning the lieutenant, during the ride,
spoke suddenly:</p>

<p>“There goes our river!”</p>

<p>All near him looked. Kit Carson chuckled quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s flopped for a spell. Now it’ll flow bottom-side-up
till it’s ready to turn over ag’in: the bed’s
on top an’ the water’s under. It’s the Mohave, sure—tho’
I’ve seen other rivers like it.”</p>

<p>“Remarkable!” ejaculated Mr. Preuss, much interested.
“It burrows like a gopher of the plains.”</p>

<p>“Brave stream! I teenk she gets weak by the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
an’ goes under to get strong, encore,” proffered Alexander
Godey, gayly.</p>

<p>“What it does is to follow the bed-rock,” explained
the lieutenant. “The water sinks to the rock. Where
the rock stratum lies deep, the water disappears in
the sand; where the rock stratum approaches the surface,
the water is brought above the sand again.”</p>

<p>For about sixteen miles the course of the stream
was dust-dry; then, suddenly, out had popped the water,
in a series of welcome pools. By the tokens of bones
and rags this evidently was a customary camping-ground,
between marches. When Oliver, who had
been busy helping herd the cavvy, returned to the fires,
he beheld there six strange Indians—the six who had
been spoken of by the mansito guide, and who had
been in advance of the company.</p>

<p>Five were Mohaves, and one was a California Indian
who lived with them. All were naked; the Mohaves,
of coppery bronze skin, straight legs, tall erect
stature, were the handsomest Indians whom Oliver ever
had seen. The party were equipped with unusually
long bows, and each man carried a gourd, slung in a
cord mesh, for water. The Californian spoke some
Spanish, learned at the missions. He said that they
came from a large village of the Mohaves at the crossing
of the River Colorado, below the large canyons,
in the desert three days’ travel eastward.</p>

<p>“I remember the village,” confirmed Kit. “Captain
Young crossed thar, when we came out in Twenty-nine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Injuns war peaceable: we bought a fat mare to
eat, an’ some squash, for we war nigh starved. But
same Injuns had attacked another party, at the crossing,
year before, so we war watching sharp.”</p>

<p>From the camp where the Indians joined, the Frémont
and Carson company followed a little further
down the erratic Mohave River, eastward, although
the main trail veered more northward, for the ridges.
The six Indians were afoot. They claimed that when
they brought back horses the northern desert Indians
stole them. They also claimed to be poor and hungry;
and when, upon the next day’s march, three cattle,
miserably worn, must be killed, after the camp had
satisfied itself the six fell to until they had left only
the bones.</p>

<p>The Indians’ banquet began in the afternoon and
continued all the night. While Oliver and Jacob the
colored youth (to whom the Mohaves were as interesting
as he was curious to them) were watching them
as by daylight they hacked and tore at the carcasses,
from the camp welled a significant murmur.</p>

<p>“Somebody coming—riding from the no’th,” announced
Jacob. “Looks laike they’re in a monstrous
hurry. What foh, I wonder. Huh! Two men.”</p>

<p>“Man and boy; Mexicans,” proclaimed Oliver,
keener of sight.</p>

<p>Yes, by token of their serapes, or blanket-scarfs
enveloping their shoulders, and their bell-brimmed, high
conical hats, Mexicans they were; and man and boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
they were; riding desperately, upon foaming, sweating
horses, across the trackless sand and rocks, for the
camp. As soon as they arrived they were surrounded
by an excited audience, and reeling in their saddles
were telling their story. The man, with many rapid
gestures, and staccato exclamations from the boy as
well as from himself, was the chief speaker.</p>

<p>“We are Mexicans, señors,” he panted. “Two
out of a party of six in advance of the main caravan
from the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pueblo de los Angeles</span> for Santa Fé. Thirty
horses we had, and we thought by setting out ahead
we should get the better grass. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay de mi!</span> And what
happened! The other four were my dear wife, the
mother and father of this boy, and a friend Santiago
Giacome, who was our guide. We found good grass,
and at the camping-place of the Archilette, about eighty
miles beyond here, on the main trail, señors, we at last
made halt to wait for the caravan to overtake us. We
had gone into the desert far enough, being few in
numbers. But after we had been at the Archilette, unmolested,
for more than a day, señors, several Indians
ventured to visit us, from where they had been watching
us. They left us, with good words, but in a few
days afterward came back with an immense crowd,
an army of them, señors; and before we could prepare
defence they charged, shooting and yelling. We were
only six, and two of us women, with thirty horses.
Pablo (and he indicated the boy) and I were on horse-guard;
part of the barbarians surrounded the herd, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Giacome shouted to us to take it and flee—we must
save the horses while he and this boy’s father fought
to protect the women. So we did, the boy and I: we
drove the animals right through the savages, and at full
speed, with halts only to change saddles from one
mount to another, we traversed back down the trail,
until this morning we reached the camping spot of
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Agua de Tomaso,</span> about twenty miles from here. Now
having left the herd there, lest the savages should
overtake us as well as it, we were hastening on to
meet the caravan and inform it, when we sighted your
camp, señors. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay de mi!</span> Alas and alas! Our four
companions, two of them women, are murdered—and
by this time the horses also are gone!”</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay de mi! Mi madre y mi padre!</span>” wailed the
boy. “Alas! My mother and my father!”</p>

<p>During the recital the company had listened intensely;
and now at the close there was a sudden outburst
of ejaculations. Some of the men—Baptiste
Tabeau, Alexander Godey, Jacob, Sergeant Zindel, and
others—were determined to start at once, to the scene
of the attack. The lieutenant restrained them.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he cautioned. “I cannot divide the force,
boys. We have the camp to look after, to-night. The
savages may be coming down the trail. To-morrow we
will know better what to do.”</p>

<p>“It’d be dark ’fore we got to the place whar the
hosses war left,” reminded Kit, agreeing with the lieutenant.
“Injuns’ll travel fast, for a ways, after they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
take the herd, till they think they airn’t being pursued;
then they’ll stop for a feast. We’ll catch ’em jest as
soon if we start to-morrow, when they’ve slackened
up.”</p>

<p>Thomas Fitzpatrick concurred.</p>

<p>The Mexican man’s name was Andrés Fuentes; the
boy’s name was Pablo Hernandez. He was about
eleven years old, and with his large black eyes, white
teeth, smooth brown skin and regular oval features
was a handsome little fellow. The twain were told to
dismount, and stay. The lieutenant took them into
his own mess, and promised them that on the morrow
he would do what he could to avenge their wrongs.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the camp was moving, setting
course north to enter the main trail, only a few miles
distant. Here were many blackish, rocky, bare ridges,
with gullies of gravel and sand between. The gullies
formed in the spring the beds of streams; and in places
wolves had been smart enough to dig little wells, until
two feet down they reached the water which they had
smelled!</p>

<p>After twenty miles, Andrés Fuentes pointed ahead.</p>

<p>“The <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Agua de Tomaso</span>—the Thomas Spring,
señors. But I see no horses.”</p>

<p>Pablo began to cry, as his memories revived.</p>

<p>The advance scouts, whom Andrés and Pablo
were guiding, spread and rode more cautiously, reconnoitring;
but the Spring of Thomas was deserted;
neither horse-herd nor Indians were there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The signs were easy to read: the Indians had come
in, afoot, from several directions, and had gone out
driving the herd.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better follow those rascals, lieutenant,
an’ teach ’em a lesson, or the trail won’t be
safe for travel, all the year,” said Kit Carson. “If
the Injuns get away unpunished, with these hyar
hosses, they’ll take more. They’ll consider they’re
boss.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the lieutenant, “go ahead, Kit.
How many men do you want?”</p>

<p>“Godey an’ I’ll do. This Mexican’ll come, too,
if we’ll lend him a fresh hoss.”</p>

<p>“Three of you, to tackle fifty?” queried the lieutenant.
“Isn’t that a pretty big job?”</p>

<p>“Wall, I reckon we’re enough to stampede the
animals, an’ raise a little ha’r if necessary,” asserted
Kit, quietly. “Godey’s wuth a dozen ordinary men;
an’ the Mexican’s wife air captured, you remember.”</p>

<p>“All right, Kit,” responded the lieutenant. “But
we’re not asking you, or anybody, to go. That’s a
risky proposition, pursuing Indians into the desert,
and fighting somebody else’s battle. These are Mexicans—and
their own caravan will be along, soon.”</p>

<p>“Mexicans or not, they’re human beings, lieutenant,”
declared Kit, refilling his powder-flask. “Pore
critters! Think o’ having yore own wife out thar, at
the mercy o’ the savages. An’ thar’ll be other parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
travelling the trail, with women an’ property. No,
sir; those Injuns ought to be taught a lesson.”</p>

<p>Well mounted and armed, rode away Kit and
Godey and Fuentes the Mexican. Now was it mid-afternoon;
the company remained in camp at the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Agua de Tomaso,</span> to await their return.</p>

<p>There was little talk save upon the one topic: the
venture of the two knights errant and their eager
companion.</p>

<p>In the dusk of evening a single figure was seen,
returning from the direction wherein three had ridden.
He came on slowly. The camp was alarmed.
It was Fuentes, who explained that his horse had failed,
but that Kit Carson and Godey were sticking to the trail.</p>

<p>The night passed; the morning passed, and the sun
crossed the zenith to afternoon. The lieutenant fidgeted,
ill at ease, for Kit and Godey did not reappear.</p>

<p>“They’ll come, captain, but they’ll find those Injuns
first,” assured Thomas Fitzpatrick. “I know
Kit and I know Godey. They’ll run that trail to the
end. Kit never quits when once he has started.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken, when shrill and clear
pierced the hot air a faint, distant halloo—a long,
high, quavering whoop, drifting in from the black
ridge to the north.</p>

<p>“A scalp halloo, or I’m an Injun myself!” exclaimed
Fitzpatrick. “There’s Kit and Godey, with
good news, I’ll wager.”</p>

<p>Again rose the scalp halloo. All eyes were fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
upon the ridge which closed the vista in that direction.
Presently out from around a shoulder concealing
a little pass emerged a jostling bunch of horses; two
riders were driving; at rapid trot and lope they crossed
the little strip of plain, for the camp.</p>

<p>“Kit and Godey! I told you!” cried Thomas
Fitzpatrick. “Look at the hosses?”</p>

<p>“The very horses! Those are they—I recognize
them; don’t you, Pablo?” claimed Fuentes, jubilantly;
and he added, now mournful: “But I see only the two
persons—the same who went. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay de mi!</span>”</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay de mi! Mi madre y mi padre!</span>” wailed Pablo.</p>

<p>“Godey—he has scalps! See, on his gun!”
directed Baptiste Tabeau, capering. “Yes! Two!
Tied to the end of his gun!”</p>

<p>“They overtook the Indians as well as the horses,”
remarked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>With whoop from Kit Carson and wide smile
from Godey, triumphant the twain rode in. As said
by Baptiste, from the end of Godey’s long-barrelled
rifle dangled two fresh scalps, of black, Indian hair.</p>

<p>How the camp cheered. As soon as the horses had
been thrown in with herd, around Kit and Godey
gathered the camp, breathless to hear the story.</p>

<p>“Oh, Godey can tell it,” responded to the inquiries
Kit. “Thar’s nothing to tell, anyhow. We
followed the trail an’ found the Injuns an’ took the
hosses an’ a couple o’ scalps, an’ hyar we air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“And my people, señor—my wife, and the mother
and father of Pablo, and Santiago? Nothing of
them?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of them, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo,</span>” said Kit Carson,
gently; and turned away.</p>

<p>Godey, by no means loath, was recounting, in his
dramatic French fashion, while to his words his auditors,
particularly the other French, wagged their heads.</p>

<p>“At night we entered the mountains, but as you
know there is a moon enough, and we followed the
trail clear till midnight. We rode hard, my friends,
for we are two mountain-men, and not afraid of these
dogs of Pah-Utes, who eat horses and lizards. Then
in a black gulch we must stop. Here the moon, being
low, did not shine, and the trail was faint among the
rocks. We must dismount, and upon hands and knees
feel for it. By the sign we knew that the savages were
only a few hours in advance of us. They had not
eaten, and soon they would wish to taste horse. That
is the use to which these desert Indians put the horse
and the mule: they eat him, they do not ride him.
So lest we lose the trail altogether we tied our horses,
and without fire, that we should not be spied upon, in
our saddle-blankets we slept upon the cold rocks until
daylight. Now might we make a very small fire,
of the dried sage, which gave off no smoke, by which
we warmed our hands and cooked breakfast. Through
the gulch we rode, and after about two miles we
sighted the rascally savages. There were four lodges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of them, down in a bottom between bare hills. They
thought that no one had pursued them, and that they
were secure; for their horses were grazing without
guard, and they themselves, about thirty in number,
were feasting on horse, boiled and roasted. We could
see the kettles and the steaks. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi,</span> my friends,
but they were making very merry. Kit and I, we tied
our horses below a ridge, and crept down for the horse-herd.
By throwing stones and twigs at them we would
edge them away, slowly, until we might stampede
them. We were doing well, when, name of a dog!
A fool of a young horse saw us on all fours, and up
went his heels and how he snorted! That was enough.
The Indians sprang to their arms. ‘Come!’ said Kit.
‘At them before they have any time!’ So down we
charged, we two, yelling, and as bold as if we were
two hundred. ‘Crack!’ spoke our rifles; but hein—one
Indian fell; only one. ‘Scalp for me!’ I claimed.
‘I count coup on that fellow,’ claimed Kit. Pshaw!
We had both shot at the same! No matter. I reloaded
first, and at the crack I wiped out another. By this
time arrows were whizzing around us, from those
long, stout bows; one passed through my shirt-collar.
Here—see? But the savages had enough; away they
scampered, climbing the hills, and hiding in the rocks.
They left a boy, and the two dead men. These two
we scalped—when, horrible, the one who was shot
twice, through and through, jumped up, howling.
Wagh! I hope never to see another such a sight!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
When he howled, and before we could do what we
must do, an old squaw, climbing the hill, stopped and
looked back and shook her fist at us and cursed us.
Maybe she was the dead man’s mother; who knows?
Now we were in possession of the camp, which was
cleverly hidden in a little bottom or draw, with a good
spring. Four or five of the horses had been killed,
for a big feast; they were cut up, all ready to fill the
pots again. Many more Indians were expected; the
pots, and baskets of fifty or sixty moccasins showed
this. As for the boy, when he found that he was not
to die immediately at our hands, he sat down and
gnawed at a horse-head. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</span> What lack of feeling!
Well, my friends, we destroyed the camp, and
left there the boy, eating his horse-head, and collecting
the horses we took the back trail.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! Good!” congratulated the company.</p>

<p>“You saw nothing of the Mexican prisoners?”
queried the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Godey shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, captain. There was no sign. We think that
they must be with the other party of the savages
or else——” and Godey shrugged his shoulders,
significantly.</p>

<p>The lieutenant spoke to Fuentes, informing him.
And Fuentes, and Pablo the lad, having shaken the
hands of Kit and of Godey, thanking them for the
scout, enveloped themselves in their serapes, apart.
Sorrow sat heavy upon them. What were the horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
as compared with wife, and father and mother, and
friend?</p>

<p>Oliver overheard the lieutenant talking with Theodore
Talbot, the Washington tenderfoot who had won
veteran’s service-stripes.</p>

<p>“There you see an example of mountain-man
work, Talbot,” was saying the lieutenant. “That’s
the spirit beyond the western frontier. Here we have
two men trailing Indians—a wily foe—fifty miles
through an unknown country; attacking their camp,
which showed four lodges, each lodge presumed to
mean five to eight or more persons; driving the Indians
out, and returning, with the horses, fifty miles
again; all in thirty hours. And why? Not only for
general good, but to avenge the wrongs suffered by
Mexicans who also were strangers. I tell you, Talbot,
you’ll never meet with a bolder, finer deed of
arms. And who performed it? Kit Carson, of Kentucky
parentage and Missouri breeding, and Alexander
Godey, St. Louis Frenchman: Americans, both.”</p>

<small>POOR TABEAU PAYS THE PRICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Scalp Camp was christened this camp, of April
25 and 26, at the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Agua de Tomaso</span> or Thomas Spring,
latitude 35° 13′ 08″, longitude 116° 23′ 28″, on the
Old Spanish Trail in the northern part of the San
Bernardino Desert, southeastern California. Ahead
upon the trail was the camping-spot of the Archilette,
where had been made the attack upon the caravan
camp. Thither by forced march proceeded the
company.</p>

<p>The Mexican Fuentes informed that the first
stretch awaiting was a dry journey of forty or fifty
miles. To avoid the heat of day the company pushed
on at once, as the sun was setting. While northeastwardly
they travelled, by the warm moonlight were
revealed to them many white skeletons of horses and
mules, strewn along the way; and this was the sign
of a dry <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">jornada</span>. Forty-three miles were put behind
ere halt was made, before dawn, at a salty, swampy
place, illy fitted to refresh. The moon had sunk; but
here also the light of dawn disclosed skeletons of animals
which had perished from weakness.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 29 they were traversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a singularly silent, blasted country of blackish ridges
and twisted, squat, repulsive cactus.</p>

<p>“The Archilette is just beyond, señor capitan,”
directed Fuentes.</p>

<p>With eyes and ears alert the advance quickened
their pace. From a low ridge of bare rocks Fuentes
pointed to a spot of brush and greenness in a sandy
basin before.</p>

<p>“That is it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Come, boys!” urged the lieutenant. “Charge
it.” And down at a gallop, rifles and carbines ready,
they galloped—the lieutenant on his gray Sacramento
keeping the front, Kit racing him hard, Godey and
Tabeau and Talbot and Jacob, eager Oliver and
anxious Fuentes and little Pablo, and all, thudding to
overtake.</p>

<p>But the spring of the Archilette lay unresponsive,
seemingly without life. Only, before a willow lean-to
which had been a shelter was the mutilated body of
Pablo’s father, the Hernandez, with both legs and one
arm missing. He had stood stanch in defence of his
wife. Near by, in another willow lean-to, was the body
of Santiago Giacome, a powerful frame, also pierced
with arrows. The savages long had departed, and
they must have borne with them the mother of Pablo
and the wife of Fuentes.</p>

<p>While the party were sorrowfully regarding, out
from the bushes crept a small Mexican lap-dog—suddenly,
with glad yelps to leap upon Pablo’s legs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
lick his hand. The Hernandez dog he was; and not
having been noted by the Indians he had remained
in lonely vigil here, at this dreadful place, watching
and waiting. How glad he was to see Pablo his
young master! Pablo picked him up, and carrying him
walked along wailing, distracted:</p>

<p>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mi padre! Mi madre! Ay, mi padre y mi
madre!</span> (My father! My mother! Oh, my father
and my mother!)”</p>

<p>Fuentes wrapped his head in his serape, thus to
mourn.</p>

<p>None in the company wished to stay here, but there
was no other camping-spot, and the animals must have
water. The lieutenant wrote upon a piece of paper
a brief story of the tragedy, and by a cleft stick planted
it so that the approaching caravan might know what
had befallen their comrades. The Archilette was renamed
Hernandez Spring—<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Agua de Hernandez</span>. It
is in extreme Southwestern Nevada.</p>

<p>The march was waxing cruelly severe upon the
animals. By water and grass were they grudgingly
nourished, but by the rocks of the innumerable ridges
were their hoofs cut to the quick. Mule and horse
dropped daily. When they died by pain and exhaustion,
or must be shot, Fuentes the Mexican quickly
cut off mane and tail for hair bridles, saddle-girths, etc.</p>

<p>Amidst increasing hills, abloom with cacti and
acacia, and over a low snowy mountain into another
skeleton-strewn dry <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">jornada,</span> of almost sixty miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
rode the Frémont and Carson men. By chewing the
acid sour dock, and by sucking at the pulpy bisnaga
cactus known to Fuentes the Mexican, they moistened
their thirst; until at midnight the California mules,
breaking into a run, gave warning of water scented
more than a mile before. This was the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rio de los
Angeles,</span> or River of the Angels, tributary to the Virgin
River which itself flows south into the canyoned
Colorado.</p>

<p>Upon the bluffy bank of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rio de los Angeles,</span> to-day
styled only the Muddy River, must camp be
pitched. At daybreak Indians swarmed down. With
the first sight of them, frightened Pablo and his little
dog ran to hide in a tent and Fuentes the man exclaimed,
in furious Spanish:</p>

<p>“There they are! The murderers! The same people
who killed at the Archilette! Curses on them!”</p>

<p>A bare-footed, bare-skinned, under-sized tribe they
were, ill-looking, their hair tied in a knot atop their
sharp, restless-eyed faces. Many of them carried
hooked sticks, with which they hauled out lizards and
other vermin from holes, to cook them and eat them. All
the men bore the long, stout desert bow, and wore a
quiver bristling with thirty or forty arrows fitted to
points of volcanic glass, or obsidian.</p>

<p>Every Indian who would enter the lines of the
camp was told to leave his bow and arrows outside;
but defying the orders an old chief and several companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
forced their way in, bow in one hand, two or
three arrows ready in the other, and quiver at back.</p>

<p>“Vamose! Puk-a-chee! Get out! Outside!” were
volleyed at him the cries; and he impudently put his
fingers in his ears, as sign that he could not hear.</p>

<p>Gazing about the camp, he counted on his fingers
the inmates—including a mule that was being shod!
He counted twenty-two.</p>

<p>“Why, there are none of you,” he jeered. “But
of us——” and he pointed to the hills and mountains,
“there are many, many.” He pointed to the rifles,
of which he appeared to think little. “You have
those.” He twanged his bow. “We have these!”</p>

<p>Up sprang Kit Carson, who had been sitting near.
His tanned face was white-hot, his grayish eyes flamed
bright blue. The filthy Indian’s contemptuous, ignorant
words had stung him to the quick. He was the
Kit Carson of the Kiowa fight, at the wagon-train
corral on the Santa Fé Trail. Not since then had
Oliver witnessed him so angry.</p>

<p>He had cocked his rifle; with one hand he clenched
it, and the other hand he shook under the Indian’s
nose.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, old man!” he bade, in short, stern
tone. “Don’t say that, unless you want to die.”</p>

<p>He spoke in English; and the old chief recoiled,
his eyes darting the venom of a snake’s, as if he
understood.</p>

<p>Oliver stepped forward, ready to help the man he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
loved. Through the camp sped the click of gun-locks.</p>

<p>“Steady, Kit,” now warned the lieutenant,
alarmed. “We’re avoiding trouble, remember. He’s
only an ignorant Digger.”</p>

<p>“No Injun, Digger or not, can come into camp
whar I am an’ talk that way. We’re boss in this camp;
it’s our camp,” declaimed Kit, still angry. “They can
insult us from outside, ’cause that air Injun way; but
if we once get to letting ’em in, with arms, they’ll
massacree us, sure. This ought to be stopped right at
the start, captain.” And again he applied himself to
the hateful old chief. “Get out! Go!” Pointing,
with stamp of foot, while he relaxed not his glare, Kit
Carson at that moment looked to Oliver as fancy
once had painted him—eight feet tall and four broad.</p>

<p>Slightly wilting, but defiant, the old chief and his
squad reluctantly slunk away.</p>

<p>“Well,” commented the lieutenant, when all
breathed easier, “that old fellow was nearer his end
than he ever will be again until he meets it.”</p>

<p>Several horses and mules had been left behind, on
the trail, to be brought along, later, after they had
rested. Thomas Fitzpatrick, who had gone back after
them, now reported that they had been killed by the
Indians, cut up, and the fragments spread upon the
brush, to cure. This evening the lieutenant turned
over to some of the Indians another horse, for a feast;
but instead of pleasing the tribe it only made those
Indians who got none the more insulting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the late afternoon of May 9, and the company
had travelled twenty-eight miles up the Virgin
River from the point where, twenty miles across from
the Muddy, they had struck it. Now they were encamped
in the northwestern corner of Arizona, at the
foot of the Beaver Dam Mountains, and about opposite
the stream which here comes into the Virgin. The
camp was drowsy, after long and ceaseless vigils. A
high wind had died away to merely a faint breeze which
scarcely disturbed the summer temperature. Over the
mountain ranges to the north rested masses of white
cloud, which the sun, about to set, was tinging pink.
A strong horse-guard was out with the animals, in
charge of Baptiste Tabeau. Two sentries watched the
camp, from either end. Most of the members off duty
were dozing; but the hour was at hand when the mess
fires must be built up. The lieutenant had been asleep,
in his lodge, for three hours. The outlines of him
could be seen, through the open flaps, and under the
raised edges.</p>

<p>As Oliver, who was sitting cleaning his rifle,
glanced at him again, the lieutenant stirred, as if
awake; at that moment Kit Carson, buckskin-clad, wiry
little man, came striding quick, rifle, as customary, in
hollow of left arm.</p>

<p>“You awake, captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen Tabeau, have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Baptiste?” The lieutenant sat up. “No. He’s
on horse-guard, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Wall, he rode down the trail, after his lame mule
we left at t’other camp a mile below.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he come back?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen him.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“What!” The lieutenant hastily stood. “Who
gave him permission?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. He tuk it, I reckon. Knew we
needed the mule.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been asleep for some time. He may have
come into camp.” The lieutenant spied Oliver. “Have
you seen Tabeau, boy?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant joined Kit, outside the lodge.</p>

<p>“This must be looked into. He ought not to have
done it—he ought to have notified us and have taken
a squad.”</p>

<p>“It war only a mile, he said; so I hear,” observed
Kit.</p>

<p>“A mile is a long way, in Injun country, Kit.
Hello! What’s that?” and the lieutenant pointed.</p>

<p>The eyes of all persons thus notified leaped to the
spot. About a mile below, or down the river, had up-welled
into the calm evening air a column of thick
white smoke.</p>

<p>“Tabeau’s gone,” exclaimed Kit, instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
“That’s a coup smoke, to tell a scalp’s been taken an’
everybody should look out!”</p>

<p>“You think it means Tabeau, then?”</p>

<p>“Sartin. That’s whar he started for—that cottonwood
grove whar the camp war. The smoke’s at the
very place.”</p>

<p>“Take whatever you can get the quickest and go
down there at once,” ordered the lieutenant. “If
you ride hard you may not be too late.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ride hard, but we’ll be too late, captain,”
answered Kit, already striding away.</p>

<p>As he passed, he responded to Oliver’s appealing
gaze.</p>

<p>“That rifle ready?” He must have noticed the
cleaning operation.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Get yore hoss an’ come along. See that you don’t
lack powder, lead or caps.” And not having paused,
Kit Carson continued upon his own way.</p>

<p>Quickly spread the word, that Baptiste Tabeau had
been “wiped out.” Many more volunteers offered
themselves to Kit than he could use. Everybody liked
Tabeau; everybody wished to succor him, or to avenge
him. However, Kit deemed that a small party, if well-armed,
would be enough; so he chose Oliver, and Baptiste
Bernier, Charles Townes, Godey, and Thomas
Fitzpatrick—mountain-men all.</p>

<p>Scarcely a word was spoken, as they galloped forth.
The errand was one of sorrow and grim determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The mile was covered, and the last night’s camping
place lay right ahead. Now the high, gloomy ridges
bordering the Virgin were closing down, and the
camping place appeared sombre. Extending their
front the posse rode right in—eye and ear and finger
ready; but it was as silent and deserted as had been
the Hernandez Spring at the Archilette. Of Baptiste
and his horse, and of the lame mule which he had
quested, not a trace could be found.</p>

<p>“Better ride on down,” suggested Charles Townes.</p>

<p>“Ought to search those cottonwoods, across,” said
Kit.</p>

<p>“That’s a risky business, in the dark, when Injuns
are better than white men,” remarked Thomas Fitzpatrick,
nevertheless urging his horse into the water.
Oliver promptly did the same.</p>

<p>“I know it, Tom,” answered Kit. “But we’ll
have to take the risk.”</p>

<p>Alexander Godey interrupted. He had been examining
for sign, on down the trail.</p>

<p>“Here,” he called. “I find it! The lame mule,
an’ the savages beside him. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En avant, camarades!</span>
The savages would drive off the mule, an’ Baptiste, he
follows.”</p>

<p>Godey had read truly. Where he awaited, in the
dusk could be descried, imprinted upon the sandy
dust, hoof-marks of a hobbling mule, pointing back
down the trail, with the bare soles of Indians on either
side of them. Moreover, the hoof-marks of a horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
probably Tabeau’s horse, also were to be descried,
pointing in the same direction, but printed <em>upon</em> the
others—therefore later.</p>

<p>So they followed the trail. After about an hour
of steady, silent riding, a rustle in some bushes was
heard.</p>

<p>“S-st!” warned Kit.</p>

<p>They halted, short, and peered, and listened, holding
breath. Kit and Godey slipped from their horses,
to steal forward, noiseless as shadows. Presently they
returned, as silently.</p>

<p>“It’s the mule,” reported Kit. “It’s the lame
mule, with an arrow in her side, standing thar, to die.
They shot her an’ left her till they’d come back.”</p>

<p>“Anything of Baptiste?” demanded Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>“We found a wet place—wet an’ sticky—in the
brush. Too dark to say jest what it air,” stated Kit,
succinctly. “But it, an’ the smoke, taken together,
strike me as bad. Don’t believe we can do more till
daylight. We mout as well go back to camp.”</p>

<p>That was agreed; and sorrowfully again they rode
up the trail, soon to be guided by the glow of the camp
fires.</p>

<p>Little doubt could there be as to Baptiste Tabeau’s
fate, but of course his disappearance must be probed to
a certainty. At day-break the lieutenant himself, with
Thomas Fitzpatrick and Kit and Godey and several
others (Oliver being assigned to guard duties), departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for the wounded-mule brush, in search of
further sign.</p>

<p>When they returned, about noon, they brought
only the news which had been feared. Daylight had
shown the worst: crimson stains and crushed bushes
where Baptiste must have been pierced with an arrow;
a crimson path for twenty paces, where he had desperately
struggled along; a spot where he had fallen; and
then the trace where he had been dragged to the river
and thrown in. A shred of leather, from his saddle,
was found; but all else—horse, gun, clothing—had
vanished completely. The Diggers had taken them.
Even the wounded mule was gone.</p>

<p>Thus, May 9, 1844, perished wilderness-breaker
Baptiste Tabeau, Frémont man from St. Louis. The
place of his death is on the left bank of the Virgin
River in northwestern Arizona. So, in many a lonely
spot, sleep the brave; their monument their deeds
achieved for others.</p>

<small>THE HOME STRETCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Fain would the Frémont and Carson men have
taken the war trail and have avenged the murder of
their comrade; but their horses and mules were crippled,
the country was vast and strange, they must push
onward to safety. So they headed, as before, into the
northward. Amidst the general mutterings of anger
and bated revenge Kit Carson it was who remarked,
quietly:</p>

<p>“Wall, the Good Book says something about reaping
whar we have sowed. White men did the fust
killing, when the Joe Walker party shot down these
hyar same Diggers, on the march across from the Salt
Lake in Thirty-three. Now thar’s war, an’ thar ever
will be, an’ the white man air to blame, but the Injun’ll
suffer most.”</p>

<p>The country grew better, in appearance; cedars and
pines flourished upon the hills, birds were present, and
before uplifted snowy mountains of a loftier range.
At the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vegas de Santa Clara,</span> or the Meadows of Santa
Clara, near to the Virgin River, the company were in
southwestern Utah.</p>

<p>The Frémont and Carson company could delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
only a day at the pleasant Meadows. Soon after leaving
the camping place they noted a moving cloud of
dust on the trail behind; out of the dust cloud evolved
hurrying figures—a little squad of horsemen.</p>

<p>“Whites!” pronounced Kit, at once. “Americans,
too—an’ ride like trappers.” And—“If that
airn’t old Joe Walker, leading ’em, I’ll eat him,” he
added.</p>

<p>The pursuing squad, nine riders, and several pack-animals,
drew on at fast trot. The foremost was a
horseman splendidly large of stature, with plentiful
gray whiskers covering cheeks and chin. He threw
up his hand in salute; Kit and the lieutenant answered
in kind.</p>

<p>“Hello, Kit,” he called.</p>

<p>“Hello, Joe. Whar you bound?”</p>

<p>He had arrived, and pulled short.</p>

<p>“Jest looking for company. Saw your sign down
the trail, an’ started on to overtake ye.”</p>

<p>“Wall, you’ve done it,” commented Kit, coolly.
Whereupon he introduced to one another the lieutenant
and Captain Joe Walker, mountain-man, trapper,
trader, guide.</p>

<p>The captain had started from Los Angeles with
the annual main caravan for Santa Fé. Seeing the
trail of the Frémont and Carson company, with eight
men, Americans all, he boldly had set out, across the
desert, to catch the expedition. That was just like old
Joe Walker, Kit Carson afterwards declared. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had fought with the Diggers, killing two and in turn
receiving wounds among the horses; and here they
were.</p>

<p>For such a fighter and adventurer Captain Joe
Walker bore a singularly mild, although determined
visage, from which clear blue eyes peered out, above
the whiskers. Oliver was attracted by him at once,
and was glad when he heard him agree to guide the
company across the mountains, ahead. He had made
a specialty of the Great Basin and the approaches to
it, and had traded much among the Utes, whose country
bordered it on the east of the Salt Lake. Therefore
the region now toward the northeast was familiar to
him.</p>

<p>In central Utah the Old Spanish Trail turned short,
and east and southeast ran down for Santa Fé. This
would be the direct route for Taos and even for Bent’s
Fort; but the lieutenant wished to visit a lake called
Utah Lake, near to the Salt Lake; thence cross the
mountains back of the Salt Lake and working over to
the head of the Arkansas River, follow it down to
Bent’s Fort. The Californians Andrés Fuentes and
Pablo the boy decided to stay with the company, instead
of going direct to Santa Fé.</p>

<p>So from the turn of the Old Spanish Trail the
course was still northward, with the Wasatch Mountains
(the same which skirted on the east the Great
Salt Lake) snowy at the right. They were greeted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
friends; good they looked to Kit Carson and the other
mountain-men.</p>

<p>The Sevier River barred the way. In California a
river, barring, had been crossed by means of hides
removed from freshly slaughtered cattle and stretched
upon sticks. The Frémont and Carson company now
had no cattle left; but undefeated, out of bundles of
bulrushes they fashioned sharp-pointed rafts.</p>

<p>At this crossing, of the Sevier River, central Utah,
May 23, 1844, was killed by accident François Badeau,
who shot himself through the head in drawing toward
him his gun, muzzle first. He was buried upon the
bank of the stream, and there are his bones, to-day.
He, too, had paid the adventurer’s price, as well as,
in his case, the price of foolishness. The muzzle of a
gun always is dangerous.</p>

<p>Lovely Utah Lake unfolded to the view. It was
the property of the Ute or Utah Indians, who made
of it their fishing preserve.</p>

<p>Only some thirty miles to the north, and connected
by a river was the Great Salt Lake where in the
previous September the company had encamped.
Therefore had they almost completed an immense circle
of 3300 miles, and after nearly nine months they were
within thirty miles of the starting point.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they had not crossed the Great Basin;
they had only skirted it, seeking an entrance. However,
even the veteran Joe Walker could give little
definite information upon that unknown interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir; I never have been into the desert, west
o’ here,” he declared, to the lieutenant. “I’ve been in
by north, along the Mary’s River, an’ I’ve been in
by south, along the Spanish Trail; but not by the middle.
The Diggers can tell little. But I’m pretty sure
o’ one thing: there are no rivers flowing out, to any sea.
The desert has its own system o’ lakes an’ rivers. It’s
evaporation that drains the basin, an’ not outflowing.
There’s no Buenaventura, sir.”</p>

<p>“I believe so, myself,” agreed the lieutenant. “I’ve
prepared what I shall report; namely: ‘The Great
Basin: four hundred miles long, five hundred miles
wide, surrounded by lofty mountains; contents almost
unknown, but believed to be rivers and lakes which have
no communication with the sea, deserts and oases which
have never been explored, and animals and savage
tribes which no traveller has seen.’ Next time I hope
to go into it, and fathom some of its mysteries. We
shall be better prepared. A good place to strike next
time is right through this gap of thirty miles; say by
way of the south end of the Salt Lake.”</p>

<p>“When do you calculate to make the trip?” queried
Captain Walker.</p>

<p>“Next spring and summer. Kit has promised to
come. Do you think you will be free, captain? We’ll
need a good guide for the desert; I’d like to engage
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said the captain.</p>

<p>Entrancing to-day is this Utah Lake, of fresh water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
lying blue between the snowy Wasatch and the hazy
Oquirrh or Squirrel Ranges, with the Great Salt Lake
showing silver sheen amidst the lowlands to the west
of north. When on May 25 the Frémont and Carson
company arrived, two villages of Utes were encamped
by the lake, waiting for the fish to ascend into the
rivers. These fish were salmon-trout, but not so large
and so tasty as the salmon-trout of the Pyramid Lake,
far across the desert.</p>

<p>Attractive though the spot was, the Frémont and
Carson company must not linger; the Utes were greedy
and troublesome, the trail yet was long, for more than
a year the lieutenant had been cut off from news of
home, well-nigh for a year Kit had not heard from his
bride.</p>

<p>Under guidance of Captain Walker, up the Spanish
Fork River which from eastward enters the Utah Lake
they journeyed, and from the head of the Spanish
Fork River north into the Uintah country of present
northeastern Utah. Here, latitude 40° 27′ 45″, longitude
109° 56′ 42″, at the first forks of the Uintah
River, above where it empties into the mighty Green,
was the fur-trading post of Fort Uintah, whose owner,
lean, swarthy Antoine Roubideau, or Robidoux, was a
Taos man.</p>

<p>At Fort Uintah was enrolled by the lieutenant
Auguste Archambeau, a Canadian Frenchman, who
wished to go on to Missouri, and who enlisted as a
hunter. Auguste speedily made himself a favorite, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
he was well built, cheerful, and a mountain-man equal
to Alexander Godey.</p>

<p>On through rich mountain country, along the borderline
of northwestern Colorado and southwestern
Wyoming, rode the company; as they went, feasting
upon buffalo, for the hunters’ rifles were ever busy.
In the morning of June 13 the Continental Divide of
the Rockies was topped, and with a cheer all hailed a
little stream trickling for the east. This was the
Atlantic Slope of the continent; it was the United
States.</p>

<p>Flowers bloomed, aspens quivered, grass and bush
spread fresh and green, clear and cold ran the streams,
and on every side grazed buffalo, elk, and antelope.
South through the North Park of Colorado turned the
march, and down into Middle Park, where rise the
waters of the Grand River flowing west to join with
the Green.</p>

<p>But although glorious appeared the landscape, and
“fat” it was with game, Utes, Arapahoe and Sioux
made of it a battle-ground; therefore the march must
be cautious. Each night the camp was fortified; by
day scouts were thrown out, ahead, from high places
to examine the country.</p>

<p>The road was one made by buffalo, but it also was
one used by the Indians; and according to the moccasins
found upon it, and the traces of lodge-poles, an
Arapahoe village must be travelling, before. The lieutenant
and Kit and all hoped that a meeting might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
avoided; but on the morning of June 18 Archambeau
and Godey, among the scouts ahead, from a butte
shook a blanket, as signal of Indians in sight!</p>

<p>“Close up, close up!” warned the lieutenant and
Joe Walker; and in response to the word transmitted
adown the line Thomas Fitzpatrick hastened his pack-train.
The flankers drew in a little; and at faster
pace proceeded the company, as a hollow square, animals
in centre.</p>

<p>“Thar they come,” announced Kit. “’Rapahoes,
too. Humph! Treat ’em as well as we can an’ get rid
of ’em quick as we can. They’ll be spoiling for a
fight.”</p>

<p>Along the valley were trudging and riding about
thirty Indians, both women and men. They boldly
met the company, and demanded presents. They
claimed that they were going into the hills after roots
and game; but instead, as the cavalcade resumed the
march, the bucks wheeled around and galloped back
in the direction where they said they had left their
village.</p>

<p>“We’d better be forting,” counselled Joe Walker.
“Did you know any of ’em, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Never saw one of ’em at Bent’s, as I remember,”
confessed Kit.</p>

<p>Down to the Grand River hurried the company, and
to some willows between the channel and an overflowed
meadow. They had no time to fort further,
even by piling up their packs, when on came again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Arapahoes, fully 200, painted and flourishing
weapons and apparently eager for a fight.</p>

<p>“Set that flag out, in front, somebody who talks
Arapahoe, and tell them if they pass it, we fire,”
ordered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Alexander Godey grabbed it; but Kit Carson rode
out with him. They planted the staff in the moist
ground, and standing by the Stars and Stripes signed
to the Indians to halt. Kit shouted the instructions.
Two of the Indians rode forward, in token of parley.</p>

<p>“One o’ them’s a Sioux,” asserted Thomas Fitzpatrick.
“Isn’t that so, Auguste?”</p>

<p>“I think it is,” affirmed Archambeau. “Sioux an’
’Rapahoe together mek it bad; eh?”</p>

<p>The conference soon dissolved, and with one of the
Indians Kit loped back to the willows; Godey remained,
amicably squatting and talking with the other.</p>

<p>“They’re ’Rapahoes, an’ some Sioux,” explained
Kit. “This hyar’s an old Sioux chief, who wants to
meet our head chief.”</p>

<p>The old Sioux—a grizzled, stout, but fine-looking
veteran, wearing a necklace of grizzly-bear claws—shook
hands warmly with the lieutenant, and delivered
a harangue. Kit translated.</p>

<p>“He says he’s always been friendly to the whites.
’Fore that gang started from the village they held a
council, an’ most of ’em voted to attack us, ’cause
we’d been with the Utes, an’ like as not had sold ’em
guns an’ ammunition. But the Sioux, an’ a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
’Rapahoes who’d seen us last year on the plains, an’
knew about us, voted ag’in it. He says the Sioux air
pore, an’ ought to be given a lot o’ valuable presents
for the way they voted. I expect the ’Rapahoes’ll
want as much.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” groaned the lieutenant. “No matter
how they voted, they’ll want the presents.”</p>

<p>Therefore presents were liberally distributed, under
the folds of the Flag, gently waving, perhaps for the
first time, here beside the Grand River in north central
Colorado.</p>

<p>Through Middle Park the trail continued, and so
did the evidences of the Arapahoes. At the south end
of the park six beaver trappers were met. They informed
the lieutenant that two of their party already
had been killed by the Arapahoes, and that if he would
wait they would like to pack up and get out. He sent
Kit and Archambeau and Godey with them, to help.</p>

<p>When the squad again joined the command, they
brought alarming news. Near the trapper camp they
had suddenly been stayed by a band of Arapahoes,
much excited. The Arapahoes said that their people
were about to make a great attack upon the Utes, in the
Bayou Salade (which as South Park lies adjacent to
Middle Park, on the south), and that they had been
sent to guide the white men back that they might help
the Arapahoes kill the Utahs! Kit had answered that
the white men were far ahead, and would join them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the Bayou Salade. Whereupon the Arapahoe scouts
rode off to their people. Kit chuckled.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take care an’ not meet ’em. They’ve
got us in a tight corner. Back yonder on the river we
swore we war the ’Rapahoe’s friend, an’ had nothing
to do with the Ute nation. Now if we won’t help our
friends fight, what air we? An’ if we do help ’em fight,
whar’ll we be, with the Utes.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t our quarrel, that’s sure,” declared
the lieutenant. “The Indians can fight their own
fights, and we’ll mind our own business. The Arapahoes
would like nothing better than to array the Utes
against us.”</p>

<p>Southward still, over the dividing range into the
South Park they hastened; and at the western verge
sounded the warning, again:</p>

<p>“Injuns! Injuns!”</p>

<p>A mounted party of dusky, long-haired figures were
descending from a ridge which intersected the valley,
before. If these were pesky Arapahoes, once more,
perhaps seeking the white men to escort them to the
battle, then the company must watch out.</p>

<p>“Make for those islands, boys,” ordered the lieutenant;
and into the shallow river, to a willow patch,
plashed the Frémont and Carson men.</p>

<p>“Those are squaws,” cried Captain Walker.</p>

<p>Ute squaws they proved to be. They eagerly
hastened to the company, and with gestures and loud
exclamations and weeping told their story. Beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
ridge was their village; early that morning the
Arapahoes had charged it, killed four men including
the head chief, and driven off many horses to a forted
hollow a mile below. But the brave Ute warriors,
300, had rallied and pursued them; and now a great
fight was in progress. If the white men would help
the Utes their friends kill those dogs of Arapahoes,
they should have the best horses at the village to carry
them into the battle.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out o’ hyar. Have to get out o’ hyar.
More trouble,” announced Kit, shaking his head at the
clamor of the Ute women.</p>

<p>Speedily the cavalcade was put in motion, to abandon
the dangerous neighborhood. Vainly the Ute
women followed, urging, wailing, and plucking at the
clothing of the white men, to bid them join in the fight.
Turning off at the ridge, and keeping it between them
and the village, with a line of scouts riding the summit
to watch the other side, the company left the valley
as rapidly as possible. Soon the women must cease
their urging, and gallop back to their village. The
spiteful cracks of rifles, and the whoops of the red
warriors, now were plainly heard; gazing down from a
break in the ridge Oliver and all could see the Ute
village, in disorder, with dead and wounded being hurriedly
brought in. However, according to the Ute
women, their braves were having the best of the fight.
It was the opinion of Kit and other mountain-men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
also, that warrior for warrior, the Utes could whip
the Arapahoes.</p>

<p>With course southeast, the company crossed from
the South Park to the tributaries of the Upper
Arkansas; and penetrating through the rugged country
lying between Cripple Creek and Cañon City, Colorado,
on June 28 arrived at the Arkansas River itself. Old
friend was the Arkansas, for now below, on it, waited
Bent’s Fort, at the crossroads of the long trail.</p>

<p>At sunset of June 29 the settlement of the Pueblo
was reached. Here the six trappers stopped, and here
Kit received word that all was well at Taos. Now
Bent’s Fort was but seventy-five miles. The trail
along the Arkansas was broad and well beaten; the
animals appeared to know that something especial was
just before, and they travelled briskly.</p>

<p>Ere mid-morning of the second day, July 1, from
the advance Oliver, greeting many a familiar object,
spied it, ahead—that one object for which in particular
had he been peering: the plains citadel of Bent’s Fort.
Amidst the fringe of cottonwoods its massy dun clay
walls were limned against the flowering herbage and
the sage.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Hooray!” Hats flew into the air, and
the reports of the carbines and rifles were answered
by cannon.</p>

<p>The flag of the ramparts was streaming to welcome
the flag of the cavalcade; and as the cavalcade drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
nearer, several horsemen clashed from the gate-way, to
give personal greeting.</p>

<p>“Thar’s George Bent. Reckon William air away,”
commented Kit.</p>

<p>George Bent it was, younger brother of William,
but a partner in the Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Co. firm. He
was much at Taos.</p>

<p>“Hello, George.”</p>

<p>“How are you, Kit? Hello, Joe! Where’d you
hail from? Come right along into the post, gentlemen.
Glad to see you back. How far have you been?”</p>

<p>“’Bout six thousand miles,” answered Kit.
“How’s my wife, George?”</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, Kit. Nothing has changed
since you left, I believe. Let’s see—just about a year,
isn’t it? We’ve all been looking for you. They’d
almost given you up for lost, in the States, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, George Bent conducted the company
to the post.</p>

<p>This was to Kit a second home: but he was anxious
to turn south for his first home—old Taos, where
bided Josefa, his young wife. Oliver was as ready,
for at Taos was Ike, maybe, or Sol, or William New,
to whom to tell tales of the trail that they had missed.</p>

<p>However, at the post a “big” Fourth of July had
been planned. The lieutenant had decided to stay for a
banquet, and Kit and Oliver must stay. So they did.
After the feast Lieutenant Frémont himself asserted
that not even in Washington or St. Louis had he ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
sat down to a finer menu than this, served in honor of
the Fourth and of the expedition, at Bent’s Fort in the
Indian country, 500 miles from the frontier.</p>

<p>On the fifth the lieutenant was to continue on for
Washington. Fuentes and Pablo, the two California
Mexicans; the Chinook youth from the Dalles of the
Columbia; and Sacramento the iron-gray horse from
Sutter’s Fort, remained with him in his train. Captain
Joe Walker wished to stay at the post for a time.
Alexander Godey was to seek St. Vrain’s, his former
station. Kit and Oliver were for Taos. The lieutenant,
last of all, shook hands with them.</p>

<p>“You’ll not forget next year, Kit?” he reminded.
“We’re to try that desert again, you know—and work
north from Sutter’s to Vancouver. The Sacramento
Valley calls.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not forget,” promised Kit. “I’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>“And you, my lad—you’ve had enough of the explorer’s
trail, I fancy,” addressed the lieutenant, to
Oliver.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Oliver, “I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” laughed Lieutenant Frémont. His fine
blue eyes flashed. “You’ll do. You’re one of my
company. You’ve got the heart of a man, and it takes
a man to follow Kit and me.”</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
